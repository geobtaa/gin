# Featured Collection: University of Chicago Library GIS Data Hub

By Cecilia Smith [University of Chicago Library GIS Data Hub](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/F12d-03&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG-e-gKCzGqzXpeCtldAapU2ejGEw)

#### What is the item? The University of Chicago’s GIS Data Hub is a portal to a curated set of historical Chicagoland data. There are currently 33 vector layers covering different themes. The data was produced by several sources, including UChicago researchers and Library Map Collection staff. #### What BTAA Library submitted the item? University of Chicago #### Interesting tidbits:
 * The collection contains the city boundaries for Chicago starting in 1868.
 * Ward boundaries for the years 1986, 1992, and 1998 are popular layers for researchers interested in redistricting <!-- more --> and social outcomes.
 * The 77 community areas as of 1990 are available, and continue to be very similar to contemporary areas.
 * A number of layers were derived from a 1948 dissertation by Henry Hughes Presler, titled "The effects of subsidy of Presbyterian Churches in metropolitan Chicago, 1871-1942." In the dissertation, Presler maps religious congregations and their ethnic makeup.
 * The hub also includes 1925 world boundaries at the country level.

#### Where can I find out more?
 * The city boundaries represent the history of Chicago’s land annexation. The[ Encyclopedia of Chicago](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/Fpages/F53.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEcZjmuqk5WTY90bU9PNguVIk3hcA) provides an interesting entry on these annexations by Louis P. Cain.
 * The [Encyclopedia of Chicago](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/Fpages/F1316.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGRrXiU4M1Nijfh1FMjxgr2cO1wpQ) also has an introduction to Chicago’s Ward System by Douglas Knox. More recently, Rober Vargas of UChicago Sociology studied the social outcomes of changing Chicago ward boundaries in [Wounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/Fview/F10.1093/Facprof%3Aoso/F9780190245900.001.0001/Facprof-9780190245900&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHIfir4mbJUbjkJPrv3f5jSTjzdvg).
 * The community areas stem from the Social Science Research Committee at UChicago in the early 20th century.
