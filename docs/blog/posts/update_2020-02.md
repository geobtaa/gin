## 

## February Highlights

-   Our Task Force is growing! We welcomed new hires from Iowa and
    Minnesota in February and are expecting 3 additional members in the
    next few months.

-   We carried out our first Help Pages sprint, which was attended by 8
    Task Force members, who created 9 new Help Topics. This content will
    populate a new Geoportal FAQ page.

-   Seven BTAA project members attended **Geo4LibCamp 2020**, and led
    multiple unconference sessions. This resulted in an updated
    [[GeoBlacklight Calendar &
    Roadmap]{.ul}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O65-R03I_jCH2ymKCxdr1xDbE-HrjbtClGOq-t928iA/edit?usp=sharing)
    to follow up on projects that were started in the sessions.

-   We also presented a **workshop** at Geo4LibCamp on our metadata
    workflows using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Looking Ahead

-   A metadata sprint is planned for March 13 to clean up subjects and
    date fields for scanned maps

-   An interview-style usability test on the geoportal will be carried
    out in late April.
