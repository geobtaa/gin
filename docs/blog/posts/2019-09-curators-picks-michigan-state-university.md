# Curator's Picks: Michigan State University

By Kathleen Weessies

#### Project Task Force Members: Kathleen Weessies, Social Sciences Coordinator and Head, MSU Map Library and Amanda Tickner, GIS Librarian Michigan State University’s contributions to the BTAA Geoportal are split between keeping an eye on GIS datasets made available around the state of Michigan and contributing items from its own collection of antique and modern maps. We are proud to draw attention to the State of Michigan’s rich array of GIS datasets which are available to use in computer modeling and GIS research projects.

In addition, the MSU Map Library purchases a significant amount of vector and raster geospatial data licensed from vendors. That content currently does not appear in the geoportal due to licensing restrictions, but much of it can be found at our Licensed Digital Maps & Data website here: [https://lib.msu.edu/branches/map/findingaids/](https://lib.msu.edu/Fbranches/Fmap/Ffindingaids/F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2FneWCY1TMxsGTzN-6tE2Q)*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://geobtaa.blogspot.com/2019/09/curators-picks-michigan-state-university.html)*.
