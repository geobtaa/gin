Project Highlight for July

__MAGIRT/WAML Webinar__

__Seven project members co\-presented a webinar titled “Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data: innovation and collaboration” for the map and geography professional organizations MAGIRT and WAML\. __

__The talk diverged from most of our previous presentations in that it focused on our current collaborative committee work more than the general project genesis and structure\. Topics included our educational tutorials\, the Diverse Collections working group\, application development\, usability testing\, promotional activities\, and our sprint model for collections\, metadata\, and blog posts\.__
