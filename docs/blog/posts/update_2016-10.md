# Project Update October 2016

<!-- more -->



## October Activities

### BTAA Geospatial Task Force Meetings

Monthly, virtual meetings of the BTAA Geospatial Task Force (members
from all participant institutions). Topics included:

-   Steering Group updates

-   Future Directions

### Geoportal Update

The [[Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal]](https://geo.btaa.org/)
now includes over 3,700 metadata records. UMN Web Development also
updated the geoportal interface to the latest version of GeoBlacklight
(which was released in late summer).

### Outreach & Promotion

Task Force members gave presentations and/or poster sessions about the
project at the North American Cartographic Information Society Annual
Meeting, the Mid-Michigan Digital Practitioners Conference, the
Pennsylvania Library Association Conference, the Wisconsin Land
Information Association, and the Minnesota GIS/LIS Consortium Annual
Conference.

## Work in Progress

### Digitized Maps

Work continues to develop and standardize workflows for the
transformation and ingest of metadata records for digitized maps. Much
of the work is concentrated on adding bounding box coordinates to the
metadata records that lack this information.

### User Testing

The Interface Steering Group met to continue the effort to assess the
interface and are working with a graduate student at Michigan to develop
a User Testing plan and task scenarios.

## Next Steps

-   Interface Steering Group will be conducting user testing and will
     report back by January

-   Continue to develop digitized map metadata workflows

-   Continue processing incoming metadata records

-   Collection Development Steering Group will identify and prioritize
     non-BTAA data sets for ingest by the end of December
