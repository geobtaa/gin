:fontawesome-solid-user: By Melinda Kernik.

## Whatâ€™s in this collection? 

The [Data Repository for the University of Minnesota (DRUM)](https://www.blogger.com/u/4/blog/post/edit/2242826800726829854/2095693966045828983#) archives data generated from student, staff, and faculty researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Over fifty of the datasets have a spatial component with varied topics, <!-- more --> including:

 * [reconstruction of river discharge since the last glacial maximum in North America](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/d8f1a763-d191-42dd-9516-d51bd06bca7f)
 * [digitized highway network showing dates of freeway construction in and around the Twin Cities, Minnesota (1920-1995)](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/c95016ec-811f-41d1-a72f-cf6603e86f50)
 * [distribution models of invasive species in Minnesota](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/f6d58f9b-600f-4bf3-8691-951a2435f9fa) 
 * Librarian curators review all submissions to DRUM and work with researchers to ensure that the data are complete and well described. 

## Collection highlight 

One of the most frequently downloaded items in DRUM is data about [racially restrictive covenants in Hennepin County](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/0455d309-e4e9-473e-8c3f-b42a6a2e16fc). The files have been downloaded more than 6500 times in the last 11 months! Racial covenants were legal clauses embedded in property records that restricted ownership and occupancy of land parcels based on race. These covenants dramatically reshaped the demographic landscape of American cities in the first half of the twentieth century. They were deemed to be legally unenforceable in 1948 by the United States Supreme Court but continued to be inserted into property records until the mid-1950s. [The Mapping Prejudice project](https://mappingprejudice.umn.edu/) compiled the data using optical character recognition (OCR) of digitized housing deeds and crowdsourcing. The attribute-rich data are available as a shapefile, spreadsheet, or web service.
