## What is the item? 

This is a map of “vice resorts” in Chicago, or places where prostitution took place during the year 1930. These areas were identified by the Chicago Committee of the Fifteen, which[ ](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/Fe/Fscrc/Ffindingaids/Fview.php%3Feadid%3DICU.SPCL.COMMITTEEOF15/6q%3D&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFcbtEUcHJsP0cEHS98icnQI293ag)[formed in 1908](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/Fe/Fscrc/Ffindingaids/Fview.php%3Feadid%3DICU.SPCL.COMMITTEEOF15/6q%3D&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFcbtEUcHJsP0cEHS98icnQI293ag) to fight “vices” in the city. Major subjects of their investigations were pandering, prostitution, crime, homosexual sex, and interracial relationships. The locations are overlaid on the 75 community areas that existed at the time. It was originally published in Walter Reckless’ Vice in Chicago (1933). <!-- more -->
