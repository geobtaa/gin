# CIC Geospatial Data Discovery Project Update March 2016

<!-- more -->


## March Activities

### CIC Geospatial Task Force Meetings

Monthly, virtual meetings of the CIC Geospatial Task Force (members from
all participant institutions). Topics included:

-   Status updates from each institution

-   Metadata workflow update

-   Data inclusion preferences discussion

-   Promotion & Outreach discussion

### Metadata Workflow

The Metadata Steering Group finalized the ISO profile of required
elements for GIS data and decided on the use of the Dublin Core metadata
standard for digitized maps. These decisions were accepted by the larger
task force and have helped the group move forward with creating metadata
editing guides.

### Metadata Conversion

Work was completed to solve the issue of how to convert FGDC metadata
stored as a text file into an XML file. This process will continue to be
useful in the future, especially when dealing with older metadata.

### Promotion & Outreach

Several task force members worked together to create a conference poster
which will be presented at the Association of American Geographers
Annual Meeting in April. Another task force member developed a
presentation for the CNI Forum in April.

## Work in Progress

### Digitized maps

Continued to investigate workflows for digitized maps. Experimented with
harvesting records from digitized map collections via OAI-PMH service
requests. So far this has been quite successful and will make the
initial metadata transfer process much more efficient.

### GeoNetwork Instance

Significant progress was made on configuring the virtual servers for
GeoNetwork to allow for collaborative metadata editing and
transformation. Final configuration should take place in early April and
training will be held in late April and early May for all participating
institutions.

## Next Steps

-   Complete the final configuration of GeoNetwork by mid-April

-   Continue processing the second round of metadata records

-   Develop workflows for including digitized maps in the geoportal by
the end of May

-   Develop training materials for Task Force members related to editing
metadata records in GeoNetwork by the end of April
