|     were addressed. One of the   |                                  |
|     sprint tasks was to make     |                                  |

-   Seven BTAA project members registered to attend **Geo4LibCamp
    2020**, and we spent time in January coordinating our plans for [[a
    new metadata
    workshop]{.ul}](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geo4libcamp-metadata-workshop/wiki),
    multiple unconference sessions, and how to reach out to other
    institutions.

-   Our [[blog post highlighting
    maps]{.ul}](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/news/2020/01/21-indian-rebellion-1857)
    in the Ames Library was noticed and retweeted by the New York Public
    Library Maps Division.

## Looking Ahead

-   **Two upcoming project sprints** are planned: a Help Pages sprint in
    February and a Metadata sprint in March. Each of these activities
    are being coordinated by committee chairs and include detailed steps
    and guidelines.

-   Two working groups are in progress to address the Strategic
    Leadership Group recommendations:

    -   The **Impact Statement Working Group** has begun polling the
        > Task Force and outlining a report.

    -   The **Licensed Data Implementation Working Group** is still
        > gathering members, but now has three collections in our
        > development site with nearly 200 data layers to evaluate.
