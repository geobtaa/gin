# Featured Collection: IndianaMap

By Theresa Quill [IndianaMap](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=09a-01) is the largest publicly available collection of Indiana geographic information system (GIS) map data. It is a collaborative project made possible by partnerships between federal, state, local organizations and agencies, and universities. IndianaMap is developed and maintained by the Indiana Geological and Water Survey and was created in part as a data sharing initiative between Indiana GIS data providers. It includes data from all 92 Indiana Counties, as well as many state agencies, academic institutions, and federal agencies.
