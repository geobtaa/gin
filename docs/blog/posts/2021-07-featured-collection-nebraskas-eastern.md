## Interesting tidbits

* The Eastern Saline Wetlands once covered an area of over 200,000 acres. Today, because of the drainages of Salt Creek, Little Salt Creek and Rock Creek and residential, commercial and agricultural development, the area is only around 4,000 acres (Lincoln Parks & Recreation, 2021).
* The Eastern Saline Wetlands is habitat for many endangered plants, birds, and other wildlife. Two endangered species are the Salt Creek Tiger Beetle and the Plains Harvest Mouse.
* Nebraska has four naturally occurring regional wetland complexes that combined cover around 1,500,000 acres.
