### Interesting tidbits:
 * There’s a good deal of interesting attribute data in the shapefile, including: the vessel type, where the vessel was built, the lives lost in the wreck, and more.
 * Using this dataset, you could create a time animation using the wreck dates or a comparison of home ports <!-- more --> and wreck locations. ### Where can I find out more?
