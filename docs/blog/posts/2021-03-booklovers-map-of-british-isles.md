“[How small the map of Britain  is on paper and yet how packed with fancies](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/Fb4ae4ae0-35e5-4221-9062-f157d1ba79b3&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGoALkpUTT-dE_7a2EnOPfFvp5_gw).”

## Ideas to explore:

* This map is from 1927. If you were updating it today, who and what else would you include?
* What other geographic places might make interesting maps for readers? 

## Where can I find out more?

* More maps of literary landmarks are available online from the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/Fmaps/F%3Ffa%3Donline-format%3Aimage/6q%3Dliterary/Blandmarks/Bmaps&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG5o35aIPE-6p-cRjRJN719lNt0gQ).
