# Geoportal Tip: Opening a dataset in ArcGIS Online

By Karen Majewicz If you are looking to perform geospatial analysis on a dataset in the geoportal, using the “Open in ArcGIS” button will come in handy. A large percentage of the geospatial data resources in the geoportal are also available as [ArcGIS Rest Services](https://developers.arcgis.com/Frest/Fservices-reference/Fget-started-with-the-services-directory.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1lqsLS7oTpnpobIxOisos1), which are hosted streaming datasets that can be added to an online map application. To find the resources with web services, use the [facet “Type” and select “Service”](https://geo.btaa.org/F%3Ff/55Bdc_type_sm/55D/55B/55D%3DService&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0t8u9zrGBiFw-MmSlZwjgF). Items with ArcGIS Rest services will have an option in the Links panel that says “Open in ArcGIS.” Clicking this text will open an instance of ArcGIS <!-- more --> Online with the selected dataset loaded. From there, you can symbolize the dataset and add other files to your map.
