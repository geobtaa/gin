# CIC Geospatial Data Discovery Project Update July 2016

<!-- more -->


## July Activities

### CIC Geospatial Task Force Meetings

Monthly, virtual meetings of the CIC Geospatial Task Force (members from
all participant institutions). Topics included:

-   Geoportal launch update

-   Using Omeka for processing digitized map metadata

-   Review of project roadmap for the near future

### New Member Institution

Indiana University joined the project in July. Project Metadata
Coordinator conducted an orientation meeting to get them up to speed.

### Omeka for Digitized Maps

Project Metadata Coordinator continued customizing Omeka instance in
preparation for processing metadata for digitized maps. Two workflow
guides were created: [[Project Profile of GeoBlacklight
Schema]](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/cicgddp-metadata-workflow/home/project-profile-of-geoblacklight-schema)
& [[Edit Dublin Core Records with
Omeka]](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/metadata-workflow).

## Work in Progress

### Geoportal Configuration

Web Development staff at UMN continued to work with BTAA staff to secure
the domain name and associated web tech infrastructure needed to launch
the geoportal.

The beta instance of the geoportal will be ready for a public launch in
early August.

### Finalizing Metadata Records

Metadata records continued to be finalized for the launch of the
geoportal in August. At present, approximately 2,326 metadata records
will be ingested by the time of the public launch.

## Next Steps

-   Launch the public (beta) version of the geoportal by early August

-   Continue processing the second round of metadata records

-   Form an Interface Steering Group by mid-August (to assess any needed
improvements and report out by the end of October)
