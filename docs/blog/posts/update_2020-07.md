# Metadata: Workflow & Schema Developments

Monthly DCAT record harvests

Our new Graduate Research Assistant made several improvements to our  _[DCAT harvesting code and process\.](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/dcat-metadata)_  This process involves monthly re\-accessions 64 open data portals that regularly publish new records and retire old ones\.

We are now developing more detailed step\-by\-step workflow documentation with the goal of sharing it across the BTAA and beyond\.

GeoBlacklight Schema 2\.0

In preparation for the upcoming GeoBlacklight Community Summer Sprint\, we have gathered several issues around metadata that the growing community is hoping to address\. These include:

More techniques for defining relationships between items

Alignment of various custom fields that could be merged into the official schema

Strategies for uncertainty in dates

Incorporating access and usage rights
