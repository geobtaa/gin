### What is the item? A map of railways and depots in Chicago and surrounding areas from 1897 by Rand McNally and Company. ### What BTAA Library submitted the item? University of Michigan ### Interesting tidbits:
 * Railways were an influential component to the incredible population growth in Chicago during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
 * The map uses color to denote North, West, and South Chicago, whose boundaries are largely formed by branches of the Chicago River.
 * The Chicago Park and Boulevard System is also highlighted <!-- more --> in green. The system is a series of parks connected by wide streets with central medians containing planted dividers. 26 miles of the system are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://geobtaa.blogspot.com/2020/01/featured-item-railway-terminal-map-of.html)*.
