## 

## March Highlights

-   We held our first metadata sprint, which was attended by nine Task
    Force members and resulted in improved metadata for over 300 maps.
    This was a great opportunity for the participants to share their map
    cataloging expertise and learn from one another. This sprint focused
    on dates and how to assign Library of Congress genre terms.

-   We completed editing the content from Help pages sprint and
    published a new page: [[Geoportal
    FAQs]{.ul}](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/help/faq)

## Looking Ahead

-   Usability testing has been postponed until Fall 2020

-   A blog posts sprint is scheduled for May 1, 2020

-   We have begun application development on the metadata editor for
    GeoBlacklight, now called
    [[GEOMG]{.ul}](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geomg).
