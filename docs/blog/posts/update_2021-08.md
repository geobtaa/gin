Project Highlight for August

__New Educational Tutorials__

The Education Outreach Working Group published five new educational tutorials this month to anticipate the Fall ‘21 semester\. The new topics include georeferencing\, digitizing\, LiDAR\, Python Notebooks\, and Story Maps\. The new collection of tutorials represent more advanced topics than our earlier introductory lessons\.

All of the tutorials were designed to meet the needs of instructors and students for detailed\, step\-by\-step explanations that address foundational to complex GIS skills\. The exercises can be incorporated into in\-person\, hybrid\, or fully online instructional contexts\.
