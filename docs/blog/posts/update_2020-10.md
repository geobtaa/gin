__Project Highlight for October__

_The Education Outreach Working Group_

_Our project has long been looking for opportunities to become more integrated into curriculums across the BTAA in order to more directly support students and faculty\.  We have begun to address this need through the activities of the Education Outreach Working Group\._

_This working group\, co\-chaired by Josh Sadvari \(The Ohio State University\) and Ryan Mattke \(University of Minnesota\)\, convened in late summer and has already published a series of _  _[tutorials](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/tutorials)_  _\. These tutorials showcase how the BTAA Geoportal can facilitate teaching and learning about maps\, geospatial data\, and GIS techniques\. They cover a wide range of activities designed to meet the needs of instructors and students in different fields and levels of competency in data retrieval\, use\, and analysis\._

_The Education Outreach Working Group Phase I sunsetted and Phase II\, which _  _will include additional tutorials\,_  _ is under development\. The group will also coordinate with the new Diverse Collections Working Group to select _  __educational disciplines to be targeted for outreach and identify geospatial resources in the geoportal that would be useful to the selected disciplines\.__
