# Project Update: September 2019

<!-- more -->

## Highlights

We accomplished several goals that improved the geoportal analytics
during September:

Web Development completely revamped the Tableau application that
combines Solr metadata with Google Analytics to give us a better picture
of what records users are searching and selecting. A script was
developed that will refresh the metadata every weekday, and new filters
were added to each view. We can now analyze the records by where users
are located, what places they are searching for, and what subject,
institution, or type values are most popular. 

Additionally, thanks to new user events that were added to the geoportal code in August, we can now see how often users click on the various tools and information buttons offered in the interface, including Metadata, Visit Source, Download, Cite, Web Services, Open in ArcGIS, and each facet. This information will be evaluated by the committees, who may recommend changes to the layout, metadata, or help text in the geoportal.
