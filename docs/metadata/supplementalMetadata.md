All other forms of metadata, such as ISO 19139, FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata, attribute table definitions, or custom schemas are treated as **Supplemental Metadata**.

- Supplemental Metadata is not usually edited directly for inclusion in the project.
- If this metadata is available as XML or HTML, it can be added as a hosted link for the Metadata preview tool in GeoBlacklight.
- XML or HTML files can be parsed to extract metadata that forms the basis for the itemâ€™s GeoBlacklight schema record.
- The file formats that can be viewed within the geoportal application include:
    - ISO 19139 XML
    - FGDC XML
    - MODS XML
    - HTML (any standard)
