# About GEOMG

	
GEOMG / GeoBlacklight Admin is a [GeoBlacklight](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight) plugin that provides a complex web-form for editing documents and an CSV-based import/export workflow for OpenGeoMetadata's [Aardvark schema](https://opengeometadata.org/ogm-aardvark/). 

It is built on [Kithe](https://github.com/sciencehistory/kithe) and is a Rubygem port of the Big Ten Academic Alliance's production workflow tool [GEOMG](https://github.com/geobtaa/geomg).

**Can other GeoBlacklight projects adopt it?**

We are currently working on offering this tool as a plugin for GeoBlacklight.

In the meantime, this presentation describes the motivation for building the tool and a few screencasts showing how it works:
