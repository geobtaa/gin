	### 1. Range Shifts Predicted with Climate Change in a Common North American Songbird
	
    **Susan Reed, Indiana University Bloomington**
    
    With a net loss of 3 billion North American birds since 1970, and 2.5 billion being native migratory birds, it is critical to investigate population dynamics and threats to species that impact abundance 1 and geographic distribution across space and time. Predicting species range in response to variation in climate is a goal shared among the fields of both conservation and evolutionary ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are visual representations of simulated spatial and temporal patterns of a species in response to predictor variables (PVs), making them useful tools for predicting a species’ range for extrapolated future climate scenarios. As rapid environmental change is experienced, animals must adapt to changes in their environment at a minimum of the same rate, lest they risk extinction. Range shifts and adjustments in movement strategies are mechanism of coping with climate change, and SDMs give insight into how these mechanisms may play out in natural populations—information that may be used to forecast population dynamics and persistence. A better understanding of where, when, and how species distributions are shaped provides valuable information to conservation practitioners, evolutionary ecologists, and policy makers for decision-making regarding habitat and species management. Here, I use ArcGIS Pro2 software to demonstrate SDMs of climate niches for a common migratory North American songbird, the slate-colored dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), utilizing contemporary and extrapolated climate scenarios to model changes in its range as it experiences climate change.
	### 2. Estimating Urban Rooftop Solar Power Production Potential In Chicago
	
    **Damian Hamielec, Purdue University**
    
    Anecdotally, Chicago has a lot of underutilized rooftop space. Consider that Chicago is extremely dense with thousands of buildings, it also has that many roofs that are rarely used for patios, gardens/green roofs, or solar installations. This analysis looks to answer how much energy could Chicago generate from rooftop PV installations that are placed in the most optimal locations throughout the city limits.
	### 3. Developing A Predictive Cultural Heritage Model of Michigan
	
    **Amanda Tickner, Michigan State University**
    
    We present a predictive model for cultural heritage management and preservation that incorporates historical features as a basis for the development of a predictive model for decision making. This presentation will describe our development process and future possibilities for expansion of our model.
	### 4. Deep learning-based tree species identification using UAV RGB images*
	
	**Yunmei Huang, Purdue University**
	
	Information at the species level is necessary for precision forest management and biodiversity conservation. However, it remains a challenging task with traditional remote sensing techniques because of the limit in imaging resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, are getting more attentions for their low-cost and high-resolution advantages. However, most of the studies focusing on UAVs images for tree species identification are based on multispectral, hyperspectral images or combined with LiDAR data. The gap exists in using UAVs RGB data to identify tree species at the stand-level in forests with various species, especially for temperate forests. In this study, we built a  species dataset using high-resolution canopy images (3-5 centimeters)  collected by drones from different seasons. Transfer learning techniques were used to test the performance on specie identification using ResNet18, YOLOv5, and EffcientNetb0, which achieved accuracies above 98% among 4 species including northern red oak, black cherry, and white oak. Testing how flight height affects species classification using RGB images from different flight altitudes is one of the projects we are working on. Tree species identification among more species and individual tree detection from natural forests will be part of our future work.
	### 5. How would SES and neighborhood environment influence individuals' physical inactivity and psychological distress in the City of Chicago?*
	
	**Bing Han, Purdue University**
	
	I propose to explore how adult physical inactivity and serious psychological distress are influenced by individual socio-economic status and neighborhood environment by using GIS data and survey data on the Chicago Data Portal. Previous research has repeatedly found that family socio-economic status is related to individuals’ health through multiple pathways, like nutrition intake, social and emotional functioning, and adoption of health risk behaviors. Meanwhile, community environments, like community crimes, green spaces, and access to public health services, are also important to people’s health. In medical sociology, the interacting effects of social factors on the individual level and resources on the community level on individuals’ health have been explored. However, it usually lacks a view of geography due to the limitation of data or methodology skills. This study aims to apply GIS to the field of medical sociology to better understand the pattern of how health is influenced. The City of Chicago provides resourceful data on health and neighborhood characteristics. I propose to combine the Healthy Chicago Survey on individuals living in poverty and the environmental data regarding green spaces, crimes, race/ethnicity segregation, education, etc. to explore is there is a moderating, say a protective, effect on community/neighborhood level environment on the negative effect of low socioeconomic on individuals’ health outcomes, including physical inactivity and serious psychological distress.

	### Justice and Social Geography

	:material-clock-time-ten-outline: 10:00 - 11:00 CST (11:00 - 12:00 EST)
    
    #### Reconstructing Historical Neighborhoods from historic Sanborn Maps Using Machine Learning
    
    **Harvey Miller, Center for Urban and Regional Analysis / The Ohio State University; Yue Lin, CURA/Ohio State; Ningchuan Xiao, CURA/Ohio State; Gerika Logan, CURA/Ohio State** 
    
    The building of the interstate highway system in US cities in the 20th century split and sometimes destroyed entire neighborhoods, mostly those housing African Americans, immigrants and other minorities. Planners of the system routed some highways, often purposely, through vulnerable and deprived neighborhoods occupied by people of color. Once thriving and full neighborhoods, these neighborhoods were split and, in some cases, even fully demolished for these urban highways. This caused an economic downturn in many of these neighborhoods that lasts until the present day. Remaining residents still live with the negative consequences of these highways, including disconnections, poor air quality, noise and road trauma. The Ghost Neighborhoods of Columbus project will highlight these lost and damaged neighborhoods by using machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques to extract building level data from historic Sanborn fire insurance maps to populate a GIS database, allowing 3D visualizations of the lost urban landscapes, and support analysis of the wealth, communities and activities lost to urban highway construction. This presentation will discuss our workflow and show results from Driving Park and Hanford Village in Columbus, Ohio – two neighborhoods damaged by the construction of interstate highway I-70.
    
    #### Using maps to communicate the relationship between broadband and health
    
    **Jess Hoffelder, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute; Anne Roubal, University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute**
    
    Broadband was highlighted as a critically important service during the pandemic. Although it is widely documented that internet availability is inconsistent across rural areas, pockets of neighborhoods in urban areas also lack access. We used the example of Milwaukee, Wisconsin a historically segregated city to show how Federally sanctioned residential segregation in the 1930’s is still reflected in health inequities in socioeconomic health metrics today. We used ArcGIS Pro to map several community socioeconomic metrics such as children in poverty, homeownership rates, and those who have completed high school, as well as historically redlined neighborhoods, against access to high-speed broadband to show the spatial patterns. We then transformed these maps into several GIFs, shared in an article on the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps website and social media platforms, to help users better overlay the different metrics. We find, unsurprisingly, that census tracts with lower percentages of broadband access are correlated with those in which more children live in poverty, fewer individuals own their homes or graduated high school, and were more likely to be redlined in the past. These findings highlight the existence of digital redlining and point to the need to reduce the inequity in broadband access to avoid further harm to communities experiencing disinvestment. 
    
    ####Overcoming the challenges of developing a geospatial database for longitudinal study of urban childhood obesity

    Childhood obesity is a complex problem to which a child's environment contributes significantly. Translating the dynamic urban realities of both the food environment and physical activity (PA) environment into consistently measurable variables is a challenging GIS problem, especially in cities with limited municipal data infrastructure. Using proximity as an indicator of access, we created an unique longitudinal dataset for this project which led to a variety of important findings about childhood obesity and access to parks and corner stores, perceptions about safety impacting walkability, and the value of developing an early habit of walking or biking to school. Since 2008, our research team built a routinely updated database representing the dynamic food environment of Camden, Newark, New Brunswick and Trenton, New Jersey. Updates included mapping corner stores, groceries, fruit and vegetable store, bakeries, butchers, supermarkets, as well as fast-food and full-service restaurants. While general food outlet data is acquired from various sources, to be valid each year’s entry needs to be checked with direct contact and using supplementary information sources (e.g. external locational data). Simultaneously, the team mapped the physical activity environment, including parks and PA facilities (like gyms). The database also includes upgrades to community PA features (like parks, trails), extracting information from city agencies, project grants and other public sources.  This presentation will provide a brief overview of the key contributions of GIS to this 15-year collaboration of multidisciplinary multi-institutional childhood obesity research. It will then focus on the geospatial challenges encountered and lessons learned.
