This collection consists of geospatial resources relevant to all disciplines. Access to resources is curated based on their authoritativeness, currency, comprehensiveness, ease of use, and relevancy. Materials included are generally publicly available geospatial datasets (vector/raster), scanned maps (georeferenced or with bounding box coordinates), and aerial imagery. Scanned maps protected by copyright are not included in the Geoportal. Access to licensed resources may be restricted to users affiliated with a participating institution.</p> <ol> <li>Geographic areas: Items in the collection vary in scale based on subject and range from global to local. Geographic areas vary based on subject and may refer to biomes/ecosystems, political boundaries, cultural boundaries, economic boundaries, or land use types. In addition to a geographic focus on the Big Ten region (i.e., the states where participating institutions are located), the collection will emphasize resources and topics relevant to faculty and student research interests and reflect the strengths of participating library collections.</li> <li>Time periods: All time periods are collected, with an ability to accommodate both current and historical versions of datasets.</li> <li>Format: The collection consists of geospatial datasets, georeferenced maps, scanned maps with bounding box coordinates, and aerial imagery. Records for web mapping applications may also be included, with priority given to applications with datasets that are also accessible for download through the Geoportal. Preference is given to open and open source formats, but other formats are accepted as required to facilitate ease of use. When possible, resources are presented in formats that allow for download capabilities. Additional software may be needed to view datasets after download.</li> <li>Language(s): The collection primarily consists of English language content. Some non-English language content may be available for certain regions, reflecting the collection strengths and research/curricular interests of participating institutions.</li> <li>Diversity: The Geoportal and its participating institutions aspire to collect and provide access to geospatial resources that represent diverse perspectives, abilities, and experience levels.

With the growing number of GIS datasets and digitized historical maps available, it can be challenging to locate the right resources since they are scattered across various platforms and not always tagged with the necessary metadata for easy discovery. To address this issue, the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project launched in 2015 to connect scholars with geospatial resources.</p> <p>One of the primary outputs of the project is the BTAA Geoportal, a comprehensive index of tens of thousands of geospatial resources from hundreds of sources. The Geoportal enables users to search by map, keyword, and category, providing access to scanned maps, digital GIS data, aerial imagery, and interactive mapping applications. All of the resources available through the Geoportal are free and open, and the scanned maps cover countries around the world. Most of the data in the catalog is sourced from local governments, such as states, counties, and cities.</p> <p>The Geoportal is a useful tool because finding local geospatial data through a simple Google search can be difficult due to the lack of visibility of these datasets. The problem is that users need to know which agency is responsible for creating and distributing the data they are looking for and visit that agency's website to access the datasets. For instance, if you are researching a particular neighborhood in a city and need data on the roads, parks, parcels, and city council ward boundaries, you might need to check different state agencies, the city or the county website. But with the Geoportal, you can easily search by What, Where, and When without worrying about the Who or Why.</p> <p>The BTAA Geoportal helps scholars find and access geospatial resources from various sources, enabling them to focus on their research rather than the time-consuming task of finding the right data.</p>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/","title":"IMPACT REPORT May 2020","text":"<p>Project Impacts: Executive Summary</p>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#participating-institutions-are-now-part-of-a-spatial-data-infrastructure","title":"Participating institutions are now part of a spatial data infrastructure","text":"<ul> <li>Involves 13 BTAA institutions</li> <li>Estimated direct cost avoidance/savings of $29,000 per institution per year</li> <li>Established governance for growth and sustainability</li> <li>Identified strategic initiatives for future development</li> </ul>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#geospatial-resources-are-easier-to-find","title":"Geospatial resources are easier to find","text":"<ul> <li>Selected and implemented GeoBlacklight \u2012 open source, spatial discovery interface</li> <li>Aggregated, enhanced, and normalized metadata records for over 30,000 publicly available resources into a single search portal \u2012 includes geospatial data, as well as scanned maps from library collections</li> <li>Increased usage \u2012 number of users was up by 25% over the past year</li> </ul>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#big-ten-academic-alliance-geospatial-librarians-and-specialists-are-more-connected","title":"Big Ten Academic Alliance geospatial librarians and specialists are more connected","text":"<ul> <li>Established monthly meetings as a large group and in topical committees</li> <li>Provided funding for members to present about the project at conferences</li> <li>Collaborated to publish 5 academic articles, present 8 posters, and deliver at least 17 presentations</li> <li>Improved workflows at local institutions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#we-are-a-leader-in-the-geospatial-community-beyond-the-btaa","title":"We are a leader in the geospatial community beyond the BTAA","text":"<ul> <li>Active leadership in the national GeoBlacklight community, including guiding development in open-source academic spatial data infrastructures</li> <li>Contributed to the GeoBlacklight codebase</li> <li>Published workflow documentation widely used by the geospatial community</li> <li>Provided consultation to similar projects at other academic institutions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>We have come a long way since the idea for a sustained collaboration across CIC map libraries germinated a decade ago among informal conversations between librarians and directors.

This paper identified geospatial data as a long-term, interdisciplinary need that would necessitate increasingly complex infrastructures to manage. The authors concluded that these infrastructures would likely be prohibitively expensive for each CIC library to maintain individually, and they proposed collaborative solutions for the long-term management of geospatial resources. </p> <ol> <li>Bidney, M., Mattke, R. &amp; Weessies, K.

Plat books are atlases showing rural land ownership and property boundaries, or real property. A plat atlas generally has a map of the featured county showing the townships and sections as laid out by surveyors. Each page of the atlas is plat of the individual townships (36 square miles) within the county, identifying who owns individual parcels of land and the number of acres in each parcel. The plat  shows township sections, roads, railroads, boundaries of towns and urban areas, and bodies of water. Local schools, churches and cemeteries are also noted on each map.

This text, published in 1969, put forth ideas about taking the ecology of a region into account when planning homes, neighborhoods, and cities. McHarg\u2019s work was particularly influential in the field of GIS for his proposed methods of using polygon overlays for analysis. McHarg was also part of an architectural firm, Wallace, McHarg, Roberts, and Todd, that was frequently contracted to work with metropolitan areas to assist with urban planning. This firm  worked with the Metropolitan Council of the Twin Cities in Minnesota during the late 1960s. Their work resulted in a report, An Ecological Study of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, that was accompanied by dozens of custom maps detailing the climate, geology, hydrology, biota, and built environment of the region. The original copies of these maps are held at the University of Minnesota\u2019s John R. Borchert Map Library. They measure about 6\u2019x6\u2019 and are a mix of base maps and mylar overlays. These maps were scanned in 2018 at high resolution for a university project to digitize them into geodatabases using ArcGIS. The scans were recently added to the digital repository at the University of Minnesota and can be found in the BTAA Geoportal here.  Researchers at the UMN Institute on the Environment recently received a grant to use this data to create an interactive application to explore the maps and potentially reveal how much of the firm's recommendations came to fruition. A few examples: </p> <p></p> <p>--- Annual Precipitation: Shows variations in precipitation across the Twin Cities in 1965 </p> <p></p> <p>--- Existing, Potential and Proposed Large Scale Open Space Colored pencil overlay indicates parks and urban areas.

Scholars experience unprecedented findability and access to datasets which in turn gives rise to new questions and research topics. In short, knowledge is advanced more broadly, more deeply and in a more timely manner. For example, every municipality, county, and state government is charged with governing some aspect of the public drinking water supply. Every unit of government generates data of one kind or another documenting aspects of water management within its  purview. Scholars studying topics such as aquifers, agriculture, contaminants such as e. Coli, or disaster mitigation draw on these public datasets to advance our collective knowledge. Each dataset is usually generated and maintained in isolation of other local and regional efforts. In the BTAA Geoportal, scholars can use one search site to find drinking water-related datasets for multiple areas: </p> <p></p> <p>--- Drinking Water: Michigan This dataset shows the locations of drinking water at recreational facilities provided by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources </p> <p></p> <p>--- Public Drinking Water Advisory Locations: Ohio This dataset locates and provides details for drinking water advisories at Ohio public water systems </p> <p></p> <p>--- Drinking Water Supply Management Areas: Minnesota This dataset includes the drinking water supply management area boundaries and the vulnerability levels within each management area in Minnesota.This was originally posted on blogger here.</p>","tags":["legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2019/12/09/2019-12-featured-collection-minnesota/","title":"Featured Collection: Minnesota Geospatial Commons","text":"<p>By Karen Majewicz </p> <p></p> <p>The Minnesota Geospatial Commons was officially launched in 2015, and serves as the state\u2019s central clearinghouse for public geospatial data.

A major turning point occurred in 1857, when Indian soldiers (known as Sepoys) serving the British East India Company revolted. Violent clashes broke out across northern India, and, although historians disagree on casualty numbers, at least hundreds of thousands of people were killed. This series of uprisings, known as the Indian Rebellion of 1957, prompted the British government to dissolve the Company and to assert their own direct control over India. Within the next few years, cartographers provided  the government with many new or updated maps illustrating British encampments, transportation routes, and the locations and dates of the major Rebellion conflicts. Many of these 19th century Indian maps can be found via our geoportal and came from the Ames Library of South Asia, housed at the University of Minnesota.

This dataset is managed by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources on the Iowa Geodata website. From this dataset, you can download the National Flood Hazard Layer, which includes the Iowa portion of the regulatory dataset produced by FEMA for their Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). It is particularly useful to community officials and members of the public who wish to know which parts of  their communities are within areas FEMA defines as having a 1-percent-annual-chance for a flood event, a 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, or minimal flood risk. In this post, I will take a look at one presentation of the data in an interactive online map. I live in Iowa City, in Johnson County. By downloading the data as a geodatabase, I can open it in QGIS, extract the features within Johnson County, and export a GeoJSON file for use in an online map. The resulting file is quite large, so potential users may wish to look into a few ways to handle large file sizes by using different data formats or employ preferred methods of reducing the size of the exported GeoJSON file. Incorporating, styling, and formatting the data for online use with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, we can see how this data can be presented in a more user-friendly format. This can then be shared with any number of stakeholders in flood-related planning or mitigation efforts. Here, the map has been furnished with a legend describing the relevant flood risk classes in Johnson County, popup content further clarifying these classes when the user clicks on a flood zone, and an information button in the top-right corner explaining the map and data sources. Users can zoom out to see Johnson County in its entirety or zoom in for a closer look at their neighborhood or property.

The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) supports local planning through its technical, data, and intergovernmental resources. The work SEMCOG does improves the quality of the region's water, makes the transportation system safer and more efficient, revitalizes communities, and spurs economic development.  * SEMCOG promotes informed decision-making by improving Southeast Michigan and its local governments through insightful data analysis and direct assistance to  members;  * SEMCOG promote the efficient use of tax dollars for infrastructure investment and governmental effectiveness;  * SEMCOG develops regional solutions that go beyond the boundaries of individual local governments; and  * SEMCOG is an advocate on behalf of Southeast Michigan in Lansing and Washington. Since its inception in 1968, SEMCOG has acted as a regional planning partner with local member governments. SEMCOG is the only organization in Southeast Michigan that brings together all governments to develop regional solutions for both now and in the future. SEMCOG membership is open to all seven counties in the region (Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne), cities (including the City of Detroit), villages, townships, intermediate school districts, and community colleges. Membership currently totals 175 entities.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>What is your role at SEMCOG? My position as Manager of Geospatial Technology at SEMCOG, allows me to focus much of my time on bringing people together to work collaboratively. We meet with counties, communities, private firms, academia, and non-profit agencies to discuss changes in the industry, best practices, and the challenges of keeping up with the ever-changing GIS technology. We share data and work together to create data that we all need. In 2010, we created the first region-wide building footprint layer and provided that data to counties and local governments. We maintain this data for most of the region, but in some cases we work in partnership with local governments who update the data and provide it back to SEMCOG. The building footprint data layer for the City of Detroit is our most popular data layer within our Open Data Portal. More recently, we contracted to create region-wide sidewalk data and made it available through our Open Data Portal. This is the newest data layer in our Open Data Portal.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>What is unique about your offerings that others would be interested to know? The SEMCOG region is just under 5,000 square miles, with a population of 4.7 million. The population is about half of the entire State of Michigan. It includes seven counties and, 234 cities, villages, and townships., Communities range from urban, to suburban, to rural. SEMCOG has been creating geospatial data layers for almost 30 years. SEMCOG creates and maintains a variety of geospatial datasets, most of which can be previewed, mapped, and downloaded through SEMCOG\u2019s Open Data Portal. Much of the data we create is needed for regional planning projects, such as transportation planning, environmental work, regional forecasting, and infrastructure work. We always have our member communities in mind when we create data. Knowing how communities use the data is important, as we want the data to be useful to others as well. If you are looking for something that you don\u2019t see in the Open Data Portal or the Map Gallery, I encourage you to contact SEMCOG by emailing infocenter@semcog.org. </p> <p></p> <p>SEMCOG Building Footprints </p> <p></p> <p>Lake St. Clair Habitat Restoration </p> <p></p> <p>SEMCOG Traffic Volume Map I would also like to highlight SEMCOG\u2019s Map Gallery. Although it is important to allow others to access and download our data, I feel it is just as important to visualize the data to tell the story of our region. We have very talented staff at SEMCOG who build these maps in a variety of mapping platforms. Within the Map Gallery, the newest maps are always at the top, under the \u2018featured\u2019 section. A few of the most recent maps are the interactive 3D Building Footprint map, the Census 2020 Self-Response Rate map, and the Lake St. Clair Habitat Restoration map. Our most popular map contains Traffic Volume data for the region. This data is very useful for transportation planning and economic development. </p> <p></p> <p>SEMCOG staff enjoy a unique spot in Detroit Thank you for the opportunity to talk about the great work that SEMCOG does.

In each interview, providers tell us about their missions and data resources. We hope this will be a great way for readers to learn more about local GIS developments and new initiatives. </p> <p></p> <p>Name: Zeb Thomas Title: GIS Data Systems Coordinator Division/Department: MNIT Services Partnering with the MN Department of Natural Resources Website: https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/</p> <p>#### </p> <p>1. What is the mission of your agency? The DNR has three primary missions: 1) to  conserve and manage natural resources; 2) to provide outdoor recreation opportunities; and 3) to support commercial uses of natural resources. These missions are sometimes in conflict, but all relate to promoting a high quality of sustainable life &amp; good management of our environment\u2026the better the data you have, the better you can conserve and manage resources.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>2. How is your geospatial data distributed? Much of the data that the DNR produces is available on the Minnesota Geospatial Commons. This website provides a way for government agencies in Minnesota to share data internally with one another and externally with the public. We are the largest contributor to the Commons, which also has data from counties, the University of Minnesota, state agencies and other local governments. In addition to datasets, the DNR publishes geoPDF maps of parks, trails, and ATV paths to Avenza for use in recreation. We also have a lot of mobile apps for distributing data; for example, RecCompass. </p> <p></p> <p>Recreation Compass is an easy to use web application showing the locations of state and federal parks, forests, land and water trails, wildlife refuges and management areas, waterfowl production areas, scientific natural areas, water accesses, walk-in access sites.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>3. What is unique about your data offerings that others would be interested to know? We have a lot of direct-to-consumer apps. These are designed for the public, not necessarily for experts. So we need to make sure that they are usable by a broad audience -- there\u2019s lots of subtle mobile cartography going on there! It\u2019s important to make sure people can understand the data so they won\u2019t end up accidentally trespassing! The DNR also has a *lot * of land to keep track of. We maintain data about the land and minerals -- so we are a first stop for people needing that info.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>4. What is your most popular dataset? Historically, it has been hydrography datasets -- the National Wetland Inventory for Minnesota and the DNR Hydrography Dataset. Another popular dataset has been wildfire tracking (Wildfires Tracked by Minnesota DNR). Counties use this for tracking costs of damage and claims. In the last year, there has been a lot of interest in data connected to the Minnesota Hydrogeology Atlas, which contains information like water-table elevation and depth to the water table. Another popular resource published in the past year has been 2019 NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) satellite imagery. We sometimes download and republish data like this - information that was created by other agencies. We have to be careful because we don\u2019t want to duplicate or cause confusion about data that will eventually be available somewhere else. But in this case, it\u2019s an important-enough resource that it\u2019s worth timely publishing and committing to taking care of the data. </p> <p></p> <p>A screenshot of the National Wetland Inventory for Minnesota</p> <p>#### </p> <p>5. Do you have any datasets / projects that are in the works you would like to share? We are working on extending our Minnesota Climate Trends application to include projections of future climate. Using a simple map interface, you can currently choose delineations of interest such as counties, watersheds, municipalities -- however you want to slice it. You can choose four counties, you can do statewide... Within these areas of interest you can see long-term climate trends from 1895 to the present day such as precipitation and temperatures. The new projections are being developed in partnership with the State Climatologist who works at University of Minnesota (in a hybrid arrangement). They are working together with DNR to produce climate predictions. The predictions look at mid-century (2040-2050) and late century (2080-2090) under two scenarios: a best case scenario and then a worst case scenario --like if we just gave up. It will be less of a month-to-month prediction of changes and more focused on broad trends. The mid-century data is already pretty scary -- for instance it predicts that there could be double digit temperature increases in winter. Hopefully the application will be available in the next few months or by the end of the year.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>6. Anything else you want folks to know? The last few months have required a large transition to work-from-home and mobile work. Our staff provide a mix of applications and support - so we do a lot of work helping others access information and technology. Data has been loading slower for folks working-from-home. We have had to be creative trying to mitigate that and walking people through workarounds. GIS is central to the DNR\u2019s mission! Thank you, Mr. Thomas for the great interview!

This tutorial reviews how to determine if metadata exist for a resource, how to review this metadata to understand the data\u2019s authority, quality, and relevance, and where to find citation information for resources found with the geoportal. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>Using GIS Web Services </p> <p></p> <p>Using GIS Web Services, by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, is meant to give GIS users a basic understanding of GIS web services, how to find them using the BTAA Geoportal, and how to use them in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Pro. The tutorial also contains a link to a walkthrough demonstrating how to use GIS web services to create an interactive web map with Leaflet. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>Linking Tabular Data to Geospatial Data </p> <p></p> <p>Linking Tabular Data to Geospatial Data, by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, provides step-by-step instructions for downloading and visualizing spreadsheet data in ArcGIS Online by linking tabular data to geospatial data with a key index variable. More specifically, the tutorial gives an overview of how to locate and download a Wisconsin county boundaries shapefile and a data table of population for each county from the US Census Bureau. The tutorial then explains how to prepare the data, add these files to ArcGIS Online, and join the Census data to the county shapefile using the matching county names column in both files. Finally, the tutorial introduces how to symbolize the joined data using county population. We hope that these tutorials will help instructors plan labs and lectures and encourage instructors to incorporate these slides into their course content. We also encourage students and geoportal users to peruse this content for a better understanding of how to use the data in the BTAA Geoportal for assignments, projects, research, and GIS activities.

Using PASDA, users can easily find geospatial data with various functions including preview and download.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>5. What is the mission of your agency? Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA) is Pennsylvania's official public access open geospatial data portal. PASDA was developed in 1995 by the Pennsylvania State University and has served as the geospatial data portal for Pennsylvania for over twenty five years. PASDA is a cooperative project of the Governor's Office of Administration, Office for Information Technology, and Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment of the Pennsylvania State University. Funding and support is provided by the Pennsylvania Office for Information Technology. Penn State contributions include system administration support and infrastructure from the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences, and the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. PASDA was developed as a service to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The purpose of PASDA is to serve as the Commonwealth's comprehensive and coordinated open geospatial data portal that provides free public access to geospatial data and information by, for, and about the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. PASDA is Pennsylvania's node on data.gov and is integrated with the National States Geographic Information Council GIS Inventory. One of the primary purposes of PASDA is to facilitate data sharing in a streamlined environment, making the process fast and easy for data sharing stakeholders. Any state agency, local government, non governmental agency, or academic institution can share its geospatial data through PASDA at no charge. PASDA is based on a long term vision that incorporates free access to data, outreach, and service to our users and data providers in order to maximize the benefits to the citizens of the Commonwealth. The keystones in the success of the program are:  * Collaboration--PASDA demonstrates that collaboration among the geospatial community benefits everyone in the Commonwealth. Collaboration saves money, time, and makes the most of the limited resources of data providers and the Commonwealth.  * Cooperation--PASDA cooperates with all levels of government, non-profits, academia, business, and citizens to support the geospatial data infrastructure and access to data.  * Continuity--PASDA works with data providers to ensure continuity of data access and long term storage and archiving of data.  * Active engagement--PASDA engages with the geospatial community to foster understanding and data sharing.  * Efficiency--PASDA's streamlined processes make data sharing fast and easy for our partners and data access simple for our users.  * Free Access--PASDA provides open access to data in multiple formats and via applications free of charge to the public.This was originally posted on blogger here.</p>","tags":["data provider interview","Pennsylvania","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2020/11/02/2020-11-featured-item-johns-hopkins-university/","title":"Featured Item: Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 Dashboard","text":"<p>By Kathleen Weessies &amp; Karen Majewicz</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Featured Item: Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 Dashboard Early on in the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, Johns Hopkins University took the lead in creating a portal of frequently updated data feeds.

The Statewide Parcel Map Initiative is an effort to create a digital parcel map for Wisconsin by aggregating local parcel datasets utilizing geographic information systems (GIS). The Parcel Initiative is a multi-faceted, multi-year collaborative effort of the Department of Administration, State Cartographer's Office, and local governments. The predecessor to the Statewide Parcel Initiative was the LinkWISCONSIN Address Point and Parcel Mapping  Project, which ran from July 2013 through September 2014. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) launched a statewide broadband initiative with goals to map broadband service within the state, develop a vision for broadband in Wisconsin, and work to extend broadband access to underserved areas. The initiative included the creation of an interactive map to track broadband availability, speed, and providers. In an effort to add capabilities and value to broadband mapping, the PSCW approved the collaboration between the State Cartographer's Office (SCO) and the Wisconsin Land Information Program (WLIP) at the Department of Administration (DOA) to develop statewide address point and parcel layers based on county data.

In each interview, providers tell us about their missions and data resources. We hope this will be a great way for readers to learn more about local GIS developments and new initiatives. </p> <p></p> <p>Name: Aaron Schill Title: Director of Data &amp; Mapping Division/Department: Data &amp; Mapping, Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) Website: www.morpc.org/data </p> <p></p> <p>1) Can you describe MORPC's mission and talk a little bit  about how the geospatial data you create support that mission? MORPC is Central Ohio\u2019s regional council for nearly 75 members comprised of counties, cities, villages, townships, and regional organizations in the 15-county region. We take pride in bringing communities of all sizes and interests together to collaborate on best practices and plan for the future of our growing region. We do this through a variety of programs, services, projects and initiatives \u2013 and nearly all of them require some type of geospatial data. Relevant, timely, and reliable data provides the foundation for nearly all of our work at MORPC. Whether evaluating transportation projects for funding, tracking regional sustainability initiatives, or developing new strategies to meet affordable housing needs, our member communities and partners look to MORPC for access to data and expert, objective analyses. Public data accessibility is an important emphasis of our work as well. We advocate for making data openly available and accessible, and we strive to do so whenever possible with the data we create and maintain. To make our work more accessible we maintain an open data site, which was upgraded to Esri\u2019s latest HUB platform last year. The majority of the data we create or maintain is available for download in machine-readable format and is highlighted in web maps, to meet the needs of various users. If you\u2019re in the MOOD to check out our data resources, visit our Mid-Ohio Open Data site at www.morpc.org/data. 2) How does MORPC compare with other agencies in Franklin County, surrounding counties, or statewide that produce geospatial data? Are there other agencies in Central Ohio that you often collaborate with on projects, and if so, what do those collaborations usually look like? Regionalism and collaboration are core tenets to everything we do at MORPC, and our data work is no different. On a daily basis, we work with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), the Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program (OGRIP), the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), county auditors and engineers, numerous municipalities and townships, and a host of other partners across Central Ohio. These days, many have their data available for download, which makes compiling local data into regional datasets or breaking state or national level data down to digestible chunks much easier than it was in the past. Our regional scope does give us a slightly different perspective than most of the organizations we work with. Rather than creating most of our own data, or accessing existing resources that already conform to our area of interest, we frequently find ourselves gathering data from diverse sources, which was often generated for a different purpose, and compiling it to meet our needs. For example, we gather and standardize building permit data from over 30 permitting agencies in the region to inform our population estimates and projections. It is a labor of love, as anyone who deals with data knows, it comes in all shapes, sizes and formats. However, it\u2019s that comfort working with messy and disparate data that allows us to be nimble and creative in working with so many partners and on so many diverse topics that are important to our community. Collaboration also comes in the form of the quarterly Central Ohio GIS User Group (COGUG) and Regional Information &amp; Data Group (RIDG) meetings we host at MORPC. All GIS professionals and folks who work with data about Central Ohio are invited to participate, and each meeting averages about 45 attendees. It is a great way to network, share information, and help each other with data and technology issues. Our Greater Franklin County Location Based Response System (LBRS) project, which began 15 years ago, is perhaps the best example of geospatial data collaboration, and has been elevated by Esri as a best practice. The project started as a way to cooperatively maintain an authoritative road centerline and address point file, to reduce redundancy. Eleven addressing authorities in Franklin County have a two-way replica of a versioned map/geodata service. They each edit it remotely and sync changes back to their version of the data at MORPC. The versions are then all reconciled with the parent geodatabase housed at MORPC. This allows the cities to focus on their own data, but benefit from current data surrounding them with the push of a button or an automated script. Over the years this methodology has expanded to include bikeways and sidewalk centerlines. 3) Can you describe what geospatial data, maps, or apps you create? What is your most popular dataset or product? As our GIS Manager, Cheri Mansperger, likes to remind us, \u201cAll data is spatial data!\u201d Given the place-based nature of our work, she\u2019s absolutely right. MORPC has core transportation and planning work that is very data hungry, so not surprisingly, almost all of the data we create or compile ties back to those purposes. Our long-range Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP), which we complete every four years is our hungriest. Any transportation project in our planning area, that will utilize federal funding, is included in the MTP and must be evaluated. Much of the data on MOOD is created because it is an input for, or an output of, the MTP. We track and map proposed development, building permits, bikeways, sidewalks, points of interest, group quarters, existing and proposed land uses and various environmental data. One output of the MTP, via our regional land use model, is sub-county population and employment forecast data for the region for the next several decades. Beyond just the data, several web apps were also created throughout the MTP process, including a map that allowed the public to draw proposed projects and comment on other proposed projects, as well as a land use review map that was shared with local governments to allow them to provide feedback on our data and forecasts. These apps are very useful both as tools to share data and as vehicles for public and stakeholder engagement. Now that the 2020-2050 MTP is finalized, the web app\u2019s final forecast data, with projections out to 2050, are hosted on MOOD. The Columbus Metro Bike User Map is another web app we host and is probably the most popular. We combine mapping of existing bikeways in the region with roads that are coded based on their \u201clevel of bike friendliness.\u201d </p> <p></p> <p>MTP 2020-2050 Population and Employment Forecasts </p> <p></p> <p>Columbus Metro Bike Map </p> <p></p> <p>Central Ohio COVID-19 Resource Hub More recently, in response to COVID-19, we created a HUB site dedicated to helping our members navigate the pandemic. It continues to evolve over time, based on needs and requests and data availability. The Esri HUB template and Living Atlas, as well as several automated data feeds our team created, make it easy to maintain and quickly share data. OGRIP also did a great job at making statewide data available. For our purposes we like to zoom in on our region, so it is relatable and easier for our members to consume. 4) Do you know of examples of how your data are being used in an educational context? If so, can you tell us more about that? If not, what would you say to encourage university instructors or students who you think could benefit from using your data in class projects? One of the interesting things about having data easily available via an open data site is that you don\u2019t know who is downloading it or what they are using it for. If the data is well formatted and has metadata, they don\u2019t even need to ask you questions about it. In the past we used to get more than our share of students calling or emailing for the bikeway, population and employment forecasts, and various other datasets \u2013 a sudden influx of requests for the same datasets was a pretty good indicator that a professor had assigned a new project. By making our data more accessible to those who are self-sufficient, our team is better able to assist those who need more hands-on support or who have more complex data needs. While many professors, researchers, and students access our data without ever interacting with a MORPC staff person, we do work closely with academic partners, particularly at Ohio State. We have a strong and growing relationship with the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis (CURA), which includes development of our recently completed Regional Sustainability Dashboard. Depending on the work, we partner with faculty and staff from across Ohio State, ranging from the Center for Automotive Research; to Planning, Architecture, and Real Estate; to the Sustainability Institute; to the Knowlton School\u2019s City and Regional Planning section, just to name a few. I would encourage students and faculty alike to check out our open data resources or to connect with our team about opportunities to work together. 5) Can you talk about any interesting projects MORPC is currently working on or that are planned for the near future? Are there new initiatives or current events that have altered your data production in any way, or new datasets you intend to distribute that might find their way into the BTAA Geoportal? We always have something interesting in the works, but a few recent and upcoming initiatives stand out. We recently completed a Regional Housing Strategy to address issues of housing supply and affordability across Central Ohio. Among the substantial data collection and analyses, we developed two new methods and datasets that are particularly unique. One was a housing submarket analysis, which divided all Census tracts in the region into 12 distinct submarket typologies based on their physical and market characteristics. The other was a displacement risk analysis, which identifies areas of the region that are experiencing or at risk of residential displacement due to varying degrees of gentrification. Both of these are first-of-their-kind analyses for Central Ohio and I\u2019m looking forward to the opportunities they create to inform better housing policies and strategies. </p> <p></p> <p>Buffer analysis for Central Ohio Greenways trail network in Franklin County, Ohio  Currently we are working on a project to prioritize all of the proposed projects for the Central Ohio Greenways (COG) trail network in Franklin County. Through analysis of our bikeway and road networks, we developed walksheds and bikesheds for the entire existing and proposed COG network. We are now developing a set of indices that can be used to evaluate the relative impact of building any given segment of proposed trail. The indices will measure a diverse range of factors including connectivity, social equity, environment, and the economy. The geospatial project I am most excited about is one that will get underway before the end of this year. We will be working with Esri and their ArcGIS Urban platform to create a 3D base map and scenario planning tool for Central Ohio. Franklin County will be the pilot area, with plans to expand out to surrounding counties in the future. Using the latest high-resolution LiDAR data and building footprints, we will work with Esri staff to build the base 3D model and incorporate existing land use and zoning data. ArcGIS Urban allows for various planning and development scenarios to be \u201cbuilt\u201d on the base model, and provides robust data analysis capabilities. This tool will help us to visualize and better understand the impacts of potential new developments across the region. Several partners have come together to help fund the project and are committed to using it in planning efforts going forward; the partners include MORPC, City of Columbus, City of Dublin, City of Westerville, COTA, and Ohio State. Once it is launched, anyone will be able to access and view the model, and any local government with its own ArcGIS Urban seats will be able to contribute their own future plans and development back to the regional model. </p> <p></p> <p>Data &amp; Mapping staff stop for a selfie after a retreat, where we volunteered at a community garden and then went for a hike.

Interviewee Name:  Todd Schuble* * Title:  GIS Manager * Division/Department:  Cook County Bureau of Technology, GIS Department * Website:  https://www.cookcountyil.gov/agency/geographic-information-systems-gis-0</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Can you describe how GIS is deployed organizationally by Cook County Government? Which units are involved and what is your mission? The Cook County Bureau of Technology\u2019s GIS Department (BOT/GIS) falls under the jurisdiction of the Cook County President\u2019s Office. All other bureaus and departments that report to the Cook County President\u2019s Office utilize BOT/GIS for spatial data distribution and curation, GIS software license access, and GIS application development. The GIS Department has close relationships with offices of other elected officials in Cook County (Clerk, Assessor, Sheriff, etc.). Those elected offices also use BOT/GIS for many of the same services as those mentioned. The mission of BOT/GIS is to create and provide validated spatial data and/or GIS applications to various departments throughout Cook County and the general public. </p> <p></p> <p>Homepage of Cook Central</p> <p>#### </p> <p>What geospatial layers and apps do you create? Which are your most popular GIS products? The number of GIS data layers and applications curated or maintained by BOT/GIS literally runs into the thousands. A majority of these items are available through Cook Central (https://hub-cookcountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/), which is the GIS open data portal for Cook County. Some of the most popular products that BOT/GIS maintains are the Cook County parcel layer, various political boundaries, or more focused applications like the Medical Examiner\u2019s Case Archive (https://maps.cookcountyil.gov/medexammaps/)</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Chicago makes up a sizable portion of Cook County. How does the size and complexity of the city impact county GIS work? How do you work with the city? The City of Chicago maintains separate GIS data layers and applications meant for its own use. The GIS work that Chicago and Cook County do often complements each other. The goal is to not duplicate services but instead to enhance them. The two local governments have a good working relationship and we do communicate when projects may happen to overlap. </p> <p></p> <p>The Racial Tapestry of Cook County. Map created by Todd J. Schuble, Cook County BOT/GIS using ESRI ArcGIS 10.4.1. U.S. Decennial Census data collected from SocialExplorer.com by U.S. Census Block Group. Municipal and community area boundaries available for download from Cook Central.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>How do you work with other local and state institutions? What other kinds of collaborative efforts does Cook County Government GIS participate in? BOT/GIS maintains strong lines of communication with the municipalities within Cook County and with the GIS departments of counties in northeastern Illinois. This communication is crucial for exchanging ideas or collaborating on validating or collecting data. Cook County\u2019s GIS Department is also an active participant in the Illinois GIS Association which represents GIS interests of numerous local government entities throughout Illinois.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Can you describe some ongoing or new projects? How have current events prompted new initiatives or workflows? BOT/GIS is always looking for new and innovative projects to dive into. BOT/GIS recently signed a contract to collect hyperspectral data for the entire county on a bi-annual basis. That new data will allow us to see various changes in the built and natural environment that would otherwise be difficult to monitor at scale. BOT/GIS is also working on constructing a 3D building layer for the entire county using previously collected LiDAR data. Even simple things, like embedding tax code boundary information directly into our parcel layer, was just produced and eases the burden on many of our municipalities from taking extra steps to hunt down that information. Due to the spread of Covid19, BOT/GIS has been working remotely since March 17, 2020 without a large disturbance to our workflow. Since our staff is technically inclined anyhow, the switch to remote work to accomplish tasks was not really that painful. The one major thing we are unable to do while working from home is being able to print paper maps. Our laptops are portable, large format plotters, not so much. </p> <p></p> <p>Cook County Medical Examiner Maps created by Todd Schuble Check out more data from Cook Central in the BTAA Geoportal here.

Finding datasets from different sources","text":"<p>By Kathleen Weessies The BTAA Geoportal brings together datasets from different sources. This can be helpful when you\u2019re looking for data gathered by multiple government units. Trails are a perfect example: The state government and a local government will be paying attention to the trails under its own care. The joggler or unicyclist, however, only wants maintained surfaces away from motor vehicles. This map shows the trail dataset available from the State of Michigan (gray dashed line) and the trail dataset from Allegan County (orange dashed line). We can readily see that each entity has features that the other doesn\u2019t.  The attribute information can also vary, depending on what the unit of government prioritized in the data gathering process. In this case, Allegan County tagged each trail by its corridor type. This allows us to separate out and highlight trails that were built on abandoned railroads (green dashed lines). The State of Michigan dataset doesn\u2019t provide this detail. This example also illustrates how data generated at the local level is often more detailed than larger more generalized datasets.

In each interview, providers tell us about their missions and data resources. We hope this will be a great way for readers to learn more about local GIS developments and new initiatives. </p> <p></p> <p>*  *  Name* * : Casey James Kohrt Title: * Geospatial Administrator Division/Department: * Iowa Department of Natural Resources, GIS Department *  Website: * https://geodata.iowa.gov</p> <p>#### </p> <p>How long has the Iowa DNR created or maintained geospatial data? The Iowa DNR has been creating  geospatial data dating to the late 1980s. It was created out of the Groundwater Protection Act, where they were to develop a map of groundwater vulnerabilities. Many datasets came out of that project, including PLSS, soils, and geology, mostly from digitizing paper maps on a digitizing table. Many projects continued, and we had a nice \u2018library\u2019 of data. We called it the NRGIS Library. In the Flood of 1993, many agencies were asking for our data, so we threw it up on an FTP server, and began publicly serving our data to anyone who wanted it.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>How is your geospatial data distributed? Currently, our data is distributed in several ways. Static datasets are served as zipped files sitting on an Amazon S3 bucket. We share the links through ArcGIS online, that cascade to an open data site, then a Hub site, which is geodata.iowa.gov. We also serve data through REST services. These feed many applications that the DNR has.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>What metadata format does the Iowa DNR use with geospatial data? We use the Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM).</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Who distributes your geospatial data? I distribute our geospatial data. I ensure that the data has the proper documentation, and then distribute it in our internal libraries, external bucket, and services, if appropriate. I then make all the entries into the ArcGIS online locations. Check out more data from the Iowa DNR in the BTAA Geoportal here.

In each interview, providers tell us about their missions and data resources. We hope this will be a great way for readers to learn more about local GIS developments and new initiatives. </p> <p></p> <p>Name:* * Julia Fischer Title: * Director, Data Services and the Maryland Geographic Information Officer (GIO) Division/Department: * Maryland Department of Information Technology (DoIT) *Website: * https://imap.maryland.gov</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Please briefly describe your role and what is the mission of your agency? Julia: As the Maryland  Geographic Information Officer (GIO) and the Director, Data Services within the Maryland Department of Information Technology (DoIT), I am responsible for leading, advancing and promoting the data services program. This program consists of three main technologies: Business Intelligence (BI), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Open Data (OD). We continue to expand the scope of the program to include data management, system interoperability and advanced analysis and conduct pilot projects using complementary technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). DoIT\u2019s mission is to provide vital technology solutions that allow the Executive Branch, State Agencies and Coordinating Offices to provide Marylanders with services that enable them to live and work more safely, efficiently and productively.\u200b In addition, the Data Services program seeks to improve the quality and lower the cost of government services, through collective investment in and effective application of data and systems and to reach beyond government by making data freely and publicly available to the fullest extent possible in consideration of privacy and security.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>What is unique about your team/department offerings that others would be interested to know? Julia: In March 2020, my team along with partners from the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), the Governor\u2019s Office and the Maryland Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) collaborated to launch Maryland\u2019s COVID-19 site at https://coronavirus.maryland.gov. The site is built on the state\u2019s enterprise GIS and Open Data platforms. The original site was developed in just over 4 hours and has since grown to welcome more than 14,000,000 visitors. The site is the nerve center focused on the health and safety of Marylanders with access to map apps that direct citizens to COVID testing and vaccination sites, as well as reporting more than 50 vital statistics related to the pandemic. In addition, site visitors can search, explore, connect to and download the raw data from Maryland\u2019s GIS Data Catalog at https://data.imap.maryland.gov and Maryland\u2019s Open Data Portal at https://opendata.maryland.gov. </p> <p></p> <p>Maryland COVID-19 Data Dashboard at https://coronavirus.maryland.gov</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Why do you think it is important to make data publicly available? Can you describe how your geospatial data is distributed? How is the quality of the geospatial data controlled before making it public? Julia: Data is the government\u2019s most valuable asset. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the State of Maryland has remained focused on providing reliable and accurate data available to the public. This focus has resulted in developing new and strengthening existing partnerships, empowering collaborative analysis and revealing correlations between previously, independently maintained data, affording the opportunity to have the best and brightest contribute answers and solutions and reaching beyond government to include members of the community who contribute valuable insights and new perspectives. Access to open data, data that is freely and publicly available to the fullest extent possible in consideration of privacy and security, is accessible from Maryland\u2019s Open Data Portal at https://opendata.maryland.gov and Maryland GIS Data Catalog at https://data.imap.maryland.gov. From these sites, visitors can search, explore, visualize, analyze, connect to and download more than 1,500 datasets from more than 60 contributing organizations, including local government partners. To provide further context, enhanced story features, which combine narrative content, data visualizations and media inputs convey how data and evidence-based information is supporting initiatives to better the work and lives of the constituents, businesses and visitors of Maryland.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>What challenges and opportunities do you see with geospatial data in your agency? Does your agency have a long term data management plan? If so can you briefly talk about data curation and preservation effort so far? Julia: Several challenges were highlighted during the recent activities related to COVID support. One in particular had to do with ensuring the reliability and securing the public\u2019s trust of the data being presented. My team is very passionate about providing reliable products and took opportunities to proactively seek feedback from Marylanders through social media and other forms of communication to ensure the best user experience. In addition, we have been in communication with leaders from the public and private sectors across the country asking questions and learning how to improve the site based on their expertise and experience. As part of the responsibilities of data management is the review of submission adhering to the established enterprise data management standards. To support the application of these standards, we developed open data inspection analysis performed using automated scripts. The analysis is performed on a granular level, inspecting each record in the dataset, as well as an analysis to ensure a valid data schema. The analysis looks for data quality, data quantity, data duplication, as well as changes to the data. Information such as blank or null values, inconsistent cell characters, and count of changed records are made available to assess overall quality value of the data. This analysis occurs on a monthly basis and runs on all datasets hosted on Maryland\u2019s open data portals.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Does your agency collaborate with other agencies, institutions and regional/local governments within Maryland? If so can you provide some successful collaborations that lead to geospatial data creation? Julia: Partnerships are an essential component of delivering valuable data to Marylanders. Local governments serve the citizens and businesses within their communities firsthand and as a result possess great insights and knowledge at a granular level. These partnerships continue to benefit from sharing data, resources and technology. This year kicked off the ninth year of Maryland\u2019s digital high-resolution imagery program. Through this program aerial photography is captured for the entire state of Maryland. This data is a valuable framework dataset, critical in supporting emergency response dispatch, surveying, environmental conservation and planning. An abundance of other programs at the federal, state, local governments, private sector, non-governmental organizations, academic and research institutions and the general public benefit from the availability of this open data. Thanks to funding from the Maryland 911 Board and support from local government partners, more than 7 terabytes of current and archival versions of this data will continue to be made available as open data to search, explore, connect and download. Another example is the on-going work related to the nationwide initiative to migrate and advance the 911 call systems to Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG9-1-1). Geospatial data provides the foundation upon which NG9-1-1 systems rely to improve response times and location accuracy each time a 911 Specialist answers the call. A significant aspect of NG9-1-1 is the expansive and expanding presence of mobile devices and data shared with mobile device vendors contributes to improvements in 911 call response times and caller location accuracy. The state coordinated with the 24 primary Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs), one within each local jurisdiction in Maryland, to prepare an authoritative, conterminous PSAP boundary layer. Available from Maryland\u2019s Open Data Portal, the PSAP boundary layer has been provided to Apple and Google who are estimated to hold 99% of the nationwide market share of mobile devices. Through these partnerships, the boundary is correlated with the location data of the mobile device caller and securely connects the caller with the appropriate PSAP. On-going maintenance of the PSAP boundary layer and open communication with the vendors will ensure the reliability of this data for NG9-1-1 systems and will help save lives.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Do you have any additional interesting and impactful work(s) you like to share that are not covered so far? Julia: The Maryland Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the Maryland Department of Information Technology (DoIT) continues to collaborate to maintain transparency of the state\u2019s budget and associated funding programs. The Maryland Transparency Portal located at https://mtp.maryland.gov is hosted on Maryland\u2019s Open Data Portal, resulting in a streamlined approach to interacting with the site and the underlying data. Portal visitors are able to access and visualize budget information, from the current as well as previous years, including expenditure and fund details, vendor payments, grant and loans, staffing counts, direct links to performance metrics and much more. Portal visitors can explore the site and quickly identify which programs received funding. The Maryland Transparency Portal provides valuable access to information to ensure the constituents and businesses of Maryland are informed on how tax dollars are being applied.

The Prairie Research Institute benefits the people, economy, and  environment of Illinois, delivering impact to every corner of the state. Our staff apply scientific knowledge and data in geology, ecology and biodiversity, archaeology, water, weather and climate, pollution prevention, hazardous waste management, and sustainable energy. PRI comprises five state scientific surveys: the Illinois Natural History Survey, Illinois State Archaeological Survey, Illinois State Geological Survey, Illinois State Water Survey, and Illinois Sustainable Technology Center. Previously embedded within a state agency, these units were moved into the University of Illinois in 2008. Because of its unique mission to provide scientific expertise to state agencies, communities, industries, and individuals, with specific responsibilities described in state statutes, PRI is funded by a separate line-item in the state budget.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>What is unique about ISGS offerings that others would be interested to know? As we are a geological survey, we have many datasets in the domain of geology, but we have also have data and applications from other surveys in the Prairie Research Institute including the Illinois State Water Survey and Illinois Natural History Survey. The ISGS is also leads the Illinois Height Modernization Program with the Illinois Department of Transportation to contract collection of LiDAR elevation data which the ISGS then distributes via the clearinghouse.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>How is your geospatial data distributed? Who distributes your geospatial data? Mostly online through traditional downloads of zipped data packages, but also through map and image services and applications. On occasion, we also fulfill larger requests via shipped hard drives. Applications range from data download for tiled data like LiDAR and aerial imagery, applications to help provide access to water and oil databases, applications that help illustrate where the state\u2019s groundwater resources come from, as well as very popular applications for determining if a given location is undermined or what its township, range, and section.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>What is your most popular dataset? Lidar is probably the most popular data on the clearinghouse in terms of downloads. But all of the aforementioned applications, while they may or may not generate downloads, it is also very popular and provide information that users cannot get elsewhere. </p> <p></p> <p>Screenshot of the Illinois Height Modernization LiDAR Data interactive map.

If so, can you provide some successful collaborations that lead to geospatial data creation? In addition to our sister agencies and the University, We also collaborate with IDNR, IDOT, IEMA, and ISP on a variety of research and support activities. Much of this has been years in the making dating back to before the clearinghouse conception in the late 1990s. Ongoing communication and teamwork have been vital to this work.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Future/what\u2019s next/what datasets, projects are in the works you would like to share? We are in the midst of transitioning our current Drupal website to an Open Data ArcGIS Hub site. This is tightly integrated with ArcGIS Online and will hopefully get all of PRI more involved in expanding our data offerings simply because of the ease of sharing through this platform. At the same time, we\u2019re upgrading to the latest release of ArcGIS Enterprise software. Check out more data from the Illinois Geospatial Data Clearinghouse in the BTAA Geoportal here.

In each interview, providers tell us about their missions and data resources. We hope this will be a great way for readers to learn more about local GIS developments and new initiatives. Name:* * Gary Motz Title: * Assistant Director for Information Services Division/Department: * Indiana Geological &amp; Water Survey *Website: * https://igws.indiana.edu/ </p> <p></p> <p>Screenshot of the IndianaMap Map Viewer. (https://maps.indiana.edu/) </p> <p>#### </p> <p>What is the mission of your agency? The mission of the Indiana Geological  Water and Geological Survey (IGWS) is to provide geological information for the energy, mineral, and water resources of Indiana. Almost all of our natural resources are very geospatially focused. We maintain a number of data platforms for disseminating and sharing geospatially focused information. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>How long has your agency created and/or maintained geospatial data? We\u2019ve been around as a state agency since 1837, and we\u2019ve been hosting the IndianaMap for at least 20 years now. Before that, we had many maps in paper form with an entire cartography/drafting section. We\u2019ve been creating and maintaining geospatial data for many decades. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>What geospatial data layers do you create? We create surveys of springs, caves, and natural hazards like earthquakes and faults among other features. This includes where you might expect to find various geological layers, what types of rocks that you would find underneath your feet in a spatial location or even in three dimensional geology if you were to stand at a point in the ground and then drill all the way through at that XY location, and how many different geological formations you would find at each depth (Z) as you're going down below the surface. Boreholes and well information is also extremely valuable information for us because oil and gas are not so much a major source of economic growth and potential for Indiana. A lot of those abandoned wells that were used back in the early 1900s for producing oil and gas are now being used for environmental reclamation for carbon sequestration, water, wastewater injection, or carbon dioxide injection. So a lot of the information that we produce is for reusing old data types for new applications because oil and gas is now carbon and it's just going in the opposite direction. We are also a publisher and aggregator, so some of the data are created and maintained by other organizations that contribute to us. IndianaMap has been a platform for people that don't have extreme GIS skills or an ArcGIS Pro subscription to be able to see it. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>How do you create the geospatial data? (workflow, departments, processes) Our cartographer, Matt Johnson, produces a lot of the visual appeal of the maps and helps with the knowledge, communication, and how the maps convey the types of information that our scientists are preparing and analyzing. Our researchers work on lots of different things by going out and collecting shallow passive seismic geophysical data. They look at subsurface reflectance of acoustic waves through the Earth to determine where the bedrock is and how much gravel from the glaciers got deposited on top of the state to see how much sand and gravel allows for that poor space for water to get in so we can learn more about water reservoirs and usefulness for utilities and public works. We build and maintain enormous geodatabases of our data and help to relate spatial data with more categorical data and empirical information from temperatures and the presence of water, and how water interacts with the rocks and the subsurface. The Information Services Division and the Research division of our organization work together to build databases, represent the data cartographically, and symbolize and document the data to produce the metadata. </p> <p></p> <p>The Indiana Geological and Water Survey's Division of Information Services who serve as the maintainers of the IndianaMap.

Not pictured: Chris Dintaman (GIS Analyst and IndianaMap liaison). </p> <p>#### </p> <p>What metadata format (documentation) does your agency use with geospatial data? We use the Federal Geographic Data Committee\u2019s Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM: https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/metadata/base-metadata/v2_0698.pdf), but we also use a number of other schemas including the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Geologic Map Schema (GeMS: https://doi.org/10.3133/tm11B10). We try to stick to the published and maintained community-based standards for documentation of our geospatial data to make sure that they are broadly useful to not only our community but can be consumed by other geospatial data communities as well. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>How is your geospatial data distributed? / Who distributes your geospatial data? We publish our geospatial data primarily using IndianaMap (https://maps.indiana.edu/), but we also use ArcGIS Online and the IGWS map (https://igws.indiana.edu/maps/categories/). We've got a number of different mapping applications depending on the theme or category of the data. If it is the statewide distribution of information, we'll put it on IndianaMap. If it's more research specialized for geological things, we'll put those on IGWS map, ArcGIS online maps, or story maps. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>Additional comments? The important thing about geospatial data is that they are so pervasive and ubiquitous. These kinds of data are frequently useful in ways in which we cannot imagine right now. Over the years we're finding more people know about the IndianaMap including realtors, bank mortgage loan officers, and other communities. The commitment to documentation and metadata has helped us to make our data useful to other communities. This is not just a preservation of information for the integrity of the work to increase the trustworthiness of our data, but also it helps to increase the societal relevance and impact of our data for future generations. People are going to use data for new and exciting purposes in the future, and that really encourages me and gives me a lot of hope. Check out more data from IndianaMap in the BTAA Geoportal here.

In each interview, providers tell us about their missions and data resources. We hope this will be a great way for readers to learn more about local GIS developments and new initiatives. Name:* * Laura Haley Title: * GIS Manager Division/Department: * Indiana Geological &amp; Water Survey *Website: * https://bloomington.in.gov/gis </p> <p></p> <p>City of Bloomington Logo </p> <p>#### </p> <p>Which departments(s) in your city is the steward of your geospatial data? What other activities  are you responsible for? The City's Information &amp; Technology Services (ITS) Department is primarily responsible for the City's geospatial data. We also have data stewards in the City Utilities Department for data specific to their operations. We are working more with the Planning and Transportation and Engineering Departments to bring them on as stewards of data they want to develop. The ITS GIS Team's other responsibilities include geospatial software/device management, mapping and spatial analysis services, application development, and user support. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>How long has your city created and/or maintained geospatial data? In the late 1980s, our City Utilities Department was needing to update their aerial quad maps and it was suggested they look into GIS. We followed closely the model set by the Indianapolis IMAGIS consortium. Data collection started in 1990 with orthophotography for the City and surrounding Utilities Service Area. It included mapping of roadways, parking lots, buildings, hydrology, and elevation features from photogrammetry. We also received the city boundary, road centerlines, address annotation, and zoning districts. City Utilities started digitizing their paper maps of infrastructure then as well. We were not able to bring in other outside partners like IMAGIS, but were soon providing data to others and continued to grow our data catalog. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>Is your data available through the state clearinghouse? Yes and No. Most of our data is available through our own public data portal, https://data.bloomington.in.gov. Some of our data gets incorporated into data on the IndianaMap via sharing with State agencies. We are working with our Country to make sure that our road centerline and address data makes its way to the State via the Indiana Data Harvest program. Most of our imagery is available through state sponsored clearinghouses. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>Who typically requests your geospatial data? And how are they used? External requests for our data have steadily decreased over the years as we publish more data sets and other sources for geospatial data increase. Most of our requests come from other City Departments putting together data sets for consultants working on planning documents, analysis, and infrastructure projects. We occasionally get requests from researchers and students for data that isn't on our data portal. Lately we've been receiving requests from journalists looking for data to support stories on recent City activities. </p> <p>#### </p> <p>How do you create the geospatial data? (workflow, departments, processes) We don't try to recreate data that is available and managed elsewhere such as County land records or State &amp; Federal Agency data. Much of our citywide base data is maintained from ortho imagery we get from the State or the County every 4 years or so. We often use contractors to help us with those updates. That imagery is high resolution so we'll use it in house as well to create features for other data sets that are visible in the photos. In between imagery projects we may import or georeference development plans for significant changes. If imagery isn't available, we'll align features to other known locations. Depending on the data, we'll have a hierarchy of available data to use. MarkUps from paper or digital maps can still be effective. In those cases it can be an iterative process where we digitize the features and send it back to the subject expert for review.

Expanding upon the collection of tutorials produced last semester, the BTAA Geospatial Data Project has published a fresh set of tutorials to assist in the instruction and learning of GIS techniques using geospatial data from the BTAA Geoportal. Once again, the tutorials were designed the needs of instructors and students for detailed step-by-step explanations, but with the goal of transferring more advanced GIS skills to learners. This second collection contains the following five tutorials as slides that can be incorporated into in-person, hybrid, or fully online instructional contexts. Georeference  Georeference* * , by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois, guides ArcMap users through the steps of georeferencing a scanned historic map of Hyde Park, Chicago. Georeferencing allows GIS users to employ scanned maps as thematically appropriate base maps for geospatial data. It is a particularly useful skill for historical work requiring GIS analysis and mapping. This tutorial explains how to select an appropriate projection, how to add and evaluate control points, how to run the rectification process, how to evaluate the results by making the scanned overlay semi-transparent, and how to publish your output as a tiled map service on ArcGIS Online. Publishing a georeferenced map in this manner allows for easy sharing over the web as well as convenient application in user-interactive web mapping. Estimated time to complete: 45 minutes Digitizing Digitizing * , by Nicole Kong at Purdue University, introduces how to use ArcGIS Pro to convert data in raster format, such as scanned maps or aerial imagery, into vector data, like points, lines, and polygons. Through the tutorial, students will get a brief overview of common digitization techniques, including preliminary evaluation of the raster data source, creating new feature classes by using different snapping methods and construction tools in ArcGIS, how to modify created features, and how to add attributes to digitized features. The tutorial also includes an exercise worksheet to reinforce the learned techniques. Supplements: Activity Worksheet Estimated time to complete: 45 minutes Creating Elevation Surface Models using LiDAR Creating Elevation Surface Models Using LiDAR * , by Milan Budhathoki at the University of Maryland, introduces LiDAR datasets and point cloud processing in ArcGIS Pro. In this tutorial, students will download a LiDAR point cloud from the BTAA Geoportal of the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. They will learn how to load this data in ArcGIS Pro and view it over a 2D map and obliquely in 3D. Following this, students will learn how to symbolize the points so that vegetation and buildings can be extracted from the dataset. Students will also learn how to filter all ground points to create a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as well as to create a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from all the points. Build a Zonal Stats Tool Build a GIS-Free Open-Source Zonal Stats Tool with Python in Jupyter Notebook* * , by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, teaches students with a basic knowledge of Python scripting how to make a free-standing zonal statistics tool that is not dependent upon desktop GIS software. This tool can be run on both MacOS and Windows and produces an input form to handle user inputs to determine the percent coverage of a given raster class range within a given polygon. For teachers and students who do not have time to download and install Anaconda-Navigator and Jupyter Notebook, there is a convenient step-by-step breakdown of the required code blocks that can be run in a Binder through GESIS Notebooks. This is particularly useful for those who want to gain a quick understanding of what the code does, but who do not have the capacity or desire to use storage space on their current computer. This tutorial is designed to initiate Python scripters to techniques for building their own GUI-driven GIS tools, which they can share with others who need simple user-friendly ways to analyze geospatial data. Estimated time to complete: 45 minutes Story Maps Story Maps * , by Ryan Mattke at the University of Minnesota, introduces the process of creating a story map by using ArcGIS Online\u2019s StoryMaps interface. This tutorial covers many of the features within this tool that are not readily apparent as well as those that are not very intuitive. Some of these include how to add credits and content attribution, changing text formatting, adding buttons and separators, embedding media, and presenting media using immersive options. The tutorial also links learners to helpful resources for creating compelling story maps.

In recent years, the University of Wisconsin-Madison has made improving access to LiDAR and aerial imagery a priority in the B1G Geoportal. Building on the popularity of the historic 1937-1941 aerial photos of Wisconsin, (one of the most popular resources in the B1G Geoportal for several years running) our current focus has been on enhancing discovery to more current aerial imagery and LiDAR elevation data currently housed within the WisconsinView repository. WisconsinView.org (part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s Space Science and Engineering Center) serves as the repository for remotely sensed data in Wisconsin -- from LiDAR and  satellite imagery, to digital orthophotography, tornado and flood data. In partnership with WisconsinView, the UW Robinson Map Library and WI State Cartographer\u2019s Office are working to write metadata and facilitate access to these collections via the B1G Geoportal. This work results in greater exposure to the data and imagery, and combines access to additional data and resources in the geoportal that may be useful in conjunction. LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth. Example derivative datasets from LiDAR include Digital Elevation Models (DEM), Digital Surface Models (DSM), derived terrain, contours, and classified point cloud data that can be interpreted in many ways. At present, there are nearly 700 LiDAR datasets for Wisconsin in the B1G Geoportal. </p> <p></p> <p>--- Sample LiDAR dataset for Columbia County, Wisconsin in 2011. Wisconsin is fortunate to have several sources of digital aerial imagery products (at varying resolutions) from federal, state, and local government sources. Aerial images from 2004-present now total over 1,500 datasets in the B1G Geoportal. Imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and Wisconsin Regional Orthophoto Consortium (WROC) make up a large percentage of the data available, and can be accessed as countywide files or by digital ortho-quarter-quad (DOQQ) tiles. Easy-to-use indexes appear in the geoportal records to determine the appropriate desired tiles. Local imagery obtained by counties is also available, including this example of 3-inch resolution imagery for Iron County for 2020. </p> <p></p> <p>--- 3-inch resolution imagery for Iron County in mrsid format from the B1G Geoportal. Future work will include adding additional historic aerial imagery collections from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Forestry Division, 2020 WI Regional Planning Commission aerial imagery, along with new high-resolution LiDAR data being acquired by Wisconsin counties each year.

Readers may use WorldCat to check for a copy at a local library.  * Reviewing Folklore-Songs of the United States, critic A. L. Lloyd writes that this \u201cingenuous compilation\u201d provides only limited coverage of its collected music and lyrics, and that the included brief notes about the music are \u201cnot always relevant or informative\u201d. Lloyd also takes issue with the ethnic and racial descriptions in the book.

This interview is part of our Data Provider Series, which highlights local governments and institutions that offer open GIS data. In each interview, providers tell us about their missions and data resources. We hope this will be a great way for readers to learn more about local GIS developments and new initiatives. Name: Tim Lauxmann Title: Geodata Data Manager Employer: State of Michigan Department of Technology, Management &amp; Budget, Center for Shared Solutions Website: https://www.michigan.gov/gis Open Data Portal: https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/</p> <p>## </p> <p>What is the mission of your organization? The State of Michigan\u2019s Center for Shared Solutions (CSS) provides  enterprise governance and delivery of services &amp; products that are common to areas within state government. CSS also manages partnerships with local governments, educational institutions, and not-for-profits to leverage technology efficiencies across traditional organizational boundaries. My unit, Geospatial Services, provides GIS related database management and support, GIS applications and application support, consulting services, and manages ESRI licensing to state agencies. We also collaborate heavily with local agencies &amp; governments in Michigan and the U. S. Census. To a certain degree we are also engaged in public outreach. I manage the Geodata Team, which is part of Geospatial Services. We maintain the Michigan Geographic Framework (MGF) and manage the Open Data Portal. My team also provides geospatial consulting and support, specialty mapping and geocoding services, creates and maintains apps for state agencies and programs, works with local agencies, and provides boundary updates for the Census. For this post, we focus on the Michigan Geographic Framework. From its inception in 2000 and through MGF version 17, updates to the framework were made annually. We are currently working on the next generation MGF (version number to be decided but let\u2019s say v21), which will be something entirely different. While the prior versions were static and updated annually, the new MGF will be dynamic. The Guiding Principles for the Michigan Geographic Framework Geospatial Data Hub:  * Create data once, use many times  * Data from authoritative sources  * Data classification by data owners  * Regular data updates and maintenance  * Effective metadata  * Partnerships and data sharing agreements  * Consistent data for decision making \u2013 local, state, federal, public</p> <p>## </p> <p>How do you create the geospatial data? The Michigan Geographic Framework is a hub of data that receives files from our data partners such as other state agencies, the federal government and Michigan county governments. MGF incorporates the processing power of the 1Spatial production engine to ingest authoritative GIS data from the data steward for that data. For example, our biggest data contributor is the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). As they have updates ready, they upload their linear reference systems (LRS) data though the portal we established for them. The 1Spatial engine processes datasets according to established business rules and incorporates it into MGF. After the initial upload, subsequent updates will only process areas identified during a change detection process and identify differences from what is already in the MGF. The process is complicated by the fact that there will be more than one contributor uploading the same type of authoritative data. In this case, local contributors (county level) will also be contributing road data. The 1Spatial business rules ensure that the data from the different contributors is processed such that we maintain one centerline. In the case of MDOT and local roads, MDOT geometry on any road that is in their LRS takes precedence over the local geometry. Conversely, local road attributes, such as the primary street name (i.e. what shows up on the street sign) and address ranges (which MDOT does not maintain but are essential for emergency services), are added to the attribute tables. This is just one example, but it illustrates how 1Spatial uses the MGF business rules to ensure data standards are maintained. </p> <p></p> <p>Guiding principles of MGF Geospatial Data Hub, example 1.</p> <p>## </p> <p>How are your geospatial datasets distributed? Some datasets are sensitive in nature and are only accessible to qualified users who are subject to non-disclosure agreements. These are generally people at various state agencies or other government inities. Other datasets are made freely available at the Michigan Open Data Portal. Traditionally, MGF has made data available by exporting layers to our Open Data Portal. Some of this data is accessible to the public and some requires permission to access. Some of the data we maintain is restricted, such as the PSAP (Public Safety Answering Points) data used by emergency services. The process of exporting to the Open Data Portal will continue. However, with the new MGF, after a contributor\u2019s data is ingested and incorporated into MGF, specialty maps will be available to our partners through the MGF Publication Portal. In line with the idea of \u2018create data once and use many times,\u2019 this means that geospatial products will be produced based on the specific requirements of the requester. </p> <p></p> <p>--- Guiding principles of MGF Geospatial Data Hub, example 2.</p> <p>## </p> <p>Who typically requests your geospatial datasets, and how are they used? We receive requests from partnering organizations and from researchers outside of government. We work collaboratively with many agencies to customize data outputs that they need to carry out their missions. One interesting example of unique data needs of various government agencies is the complicated nature of political boundaries and how they affect elections and voting. Local governments can gain land by way of the annexation process. But Michigan has an unusual temporary variation known as a \u2018425\u2019 annexation. This can mean that land belongs to a unit of government for a period of 25 or even 50 years, then might revert back to a rural township. These agreements must be tracked carefully so that voters in those areas are assigned to the correct voting precinct. Within the wording of the annexation agreement (whether regular or 425) the disposition of voters is specified. This disposition is important to the Bureau of Elections because voting precinct boundaries can\u2019t extend outside municipal boundaries. On the other hand, for others such as MDOT\u2019s Act 51 program and the Census Boundary and Annexations Program (BAS) what is important is the change to the municipal boundary not the disposition of the voters. To juggle these needs in the past, my team maintained two sets of boundary data. With the new MGF, we will have one set of boundary layers and use attributes to output the required data for each stakeholder.

This first blog is going to focus on examples of the *Interface Committee * 's recent work and how that has affected the Geoportal.</p> <p>### </p> <p>User Testing We work with students (some familiar with geospatial information topics, some not) and walk them through a series of tasks to see how they respond. Do they find something hard to do? Do they misunderstand something they so or do? Do they not see a path to get the answer? Do they run into an error?  We take the information we gather from these tests and then decide on what changes we need to make to the interface to improve it. A simple change was to add a 4th search box to the advanced search since there were only 4 search fields - a student pointed that out as something we could do! </p> <p></p> <p>Sometimes the changes are more complicated. For example, changes to the map interface may take a bit longer to implement. Adding options for help at the point of need (such as a clickable ? by certain features) would take more work. So expect to see interface changes periodically as we work through these changes. But we depend on more than just user testing to make updates.</p> <p>#### </p> <p>Diverse Collections Do you know how to see how diverse the current BTAA Geoportal\u2019s content is? It\u2019s not easy, so this leads to some future options. Which means work with some of our other committees to make the diversity of our current Geoportal content easier to see. But also, examine possibilities for future content that would be more diverse. An easy example is language. Most content in the Geoportal is currently in English. How can you tell? Well you can\u2019t. We don\u2019t use language as either a searchable field or a filter option. So only people with access to the \u201cback end\u201d of the Geoportal can tell. So adding that functionality is a desire for updates to the Geoportal. </p> <p></p> <p>This also leads to us wondering about content not currently in the Geoportal. Members of the Geoportal collectively have well over a million maps in their collections (with overlaps, of course) and those maps represent over 100 languages! Of course, the majority are in English and European languages, but you can also see thousands of maps in languages such as Japanese, Chinese, and Indonesian. But we also have very unique cases, with only one map in languages like Basa, Inuktitut, and Kurdish. If we scan these print maps and add them to the Geoportal, that means changes to the interface. And we also need to work on metadata as some Geoportal content (and some of the print maps) don\u2019t currently have languages listed. So this is just our first attempt at sharing some of what is in store for the Interface. If you have ideas or suggestions for our interface, or anything else Geoportal related, please give us Feedback! Daniel Dotson serves as the Project's Interface Committee Co-chair.

Members of the BTAA Geoportal recently examined our print collection of cataloged maps to determine the languages represented. This is not a complete picture, as many un-cataloged maps may be in non-English languages, but we wanted to carry out a preliminary analysis using readily-available data. So how did this shake out?  * Out of nearly 1.7  million maps in our sample, over 85% are in English.  * Over 75,000 maps were listed with an undetermined language, which may speak to examining them for this and other missing metadata.  * European languages by far dominated. For languages with over 1,000 maps, Japanese, Indonesian, and Chinese are the only non-European languages represented.  * Over 50 languages have 10 or fewer maps. More than 20 with just a single map. This points to some interesting possibilities for unique content that may be good candidates for future scanning projects. Want to see the numbers? English | 1,463,670 | Indonesian | 3,224 ---|---|---|--- Undetermined | 75,819 | Finnish | 3,151 German | 34,111 | Norwegian | 2,524 French | 30,702 | Swedish | 2,470 Spanish | 23,484 | Chinese | 2,126 Russian | 13,098 | Latin | 1,810 Japanese | 6,795 | Hungarian | 1,682 Dutch | 5,358 | Czech | 1,642 Portuguese | 5,238 | Danish | 1,392 Polish | 4,827 | Romanian | 1,002 Italian | 4,548 | All other Languages (~95) | 8,591 So what might we do with all this info? A few ideas:  * Scanning projects for non-Western languages to expand the diversity of our digital collections. Japanese in particular has over 1,000 maps at a few BTAA members\u2019 libraries.  * Make corrections for incorrect or outdated language codes. This wasn\u2019t a significant number of items, but these are items that should be addressed in terms of how they are described in our catalogs.  * Look at updating language info for cataloged maps without a listed language. This helps users for our print collections, but may show we have missing languages we might want to look at.  * Beyond scanning projects, could we make use of this information for local purposes? Perhaps collaborations with our area studies colleagues to support education and outreach activities?  * Working towards making sure that language is represented in Geoportal content metadata and searching. We hope there is more to come from this analysis of map languages.This was originally posted on blogger here.</p>","tags":["maps","languages","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2022/01/06/2022-01-hixson-plat-map-atlases-of-michigan/","title":"Hixson Plat Map Atlases of Michigan","text":"<p>By Kathleen Weessies The Hixson Plat Map Atlases of Michigan digital collection contains Hixson plat books for 36 of Michigan\u2019s 83 counties.

Name: El Lower Title: GLANSIS Research Associate Department/Center/Unit: Michigan Sea Grant, SEAS Preferred Web Link for department directory page or center/lab page: https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/glansis/index.html Background: The Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System (GLANSIS) is a NOAA-led inter-agency database designed to be a \"one-stop shop\" for information about introduced aquatic species in the Great Lakes. The database hosts information  on identification, ecology, distribution, risk assessments, management strategies, and more for 180+ aquatic invaders in the region, and operates in partnership with Michigan Sea Grant and University of Michigan's School for Environment and Sustainability along with many other organizations.  Grass carp shapefile displayed in ArcGIS Online How do you use GIS in your research/teaching? Mapping data is a major part of our work at GLANSIS! We host thousands of specimen records tied to geographic coordinates indicating where non-native aquatic organisms have been spotted, and have data-sharing agreements with large regional databases like EDDmapS, MISIN, iMapInvasives, iNaturalist and more to be sure we're up to date on recent sightings. Some of the first sightings of these invasive species go back to records from the 1800s, so we're a treasure trove of historic distribution data as well. For instance, here's a gif showing the distribution of each of the species we track over the last two centuries: as you can see, we've got our work cut out for us...  Combined reports of each species tracked by GLANSIS over the last 200 years What spatial data do you use or create? One of the flagship tools we have at GLANSIS is the Map Explorer, a data visualizer which allows users to create their own custom maps of species records in specific geographic locations and compare them with other species, aquatic habitat layers, or even create animated maps like the one above to show the distribution of the same species over time! Users can also download the results of their queries in comma-delimited format to use in the GIS program of their choice to further customize the design of their resulting map. You can try the GLANSIS Map Explorer for yourself here: https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/glansis/mapExplorer.php  Example of GLANSIS database habitat suitability overlay How do you incorporate students in your research? We work with a number of student interns and fellows, including partnerships with student groups through University of Michigan's School of Information, the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), Michigan State University summer fellows, and other seasonal internships. Past student projects have included everything from researching non-native reptiles of the Great Lakes to building a virtual food web using the data we host, and much more. GLANSIS data is freely available for anyone to use, and we'd love for students to utilize us as a resource for research they might be doing on the Great Lakes! We're also working with teachers and other educators throughout the region to develop classroom activities and lesson plans that combine real-world data in the form of species records with place-based education initiatives, which is very exciting. How does GIS change how research is conducted in your field? GIS is such an important part of invasive species management, particularly when it comes to early detection and rapid response efforts -- we rely on accurate, accessible map data shared between our partners and the public to help stop potential biological invasions before they begin. We regularly use spatial data to determine the status of a given species in the Great Lakes -- some of the species we track are native to one part of the US but not others, or even native to one part of the Great Lakes but are expanding their range to others due to climate change or other factors. Knowing their original range and using spatial data to track their spread helps inform the environmental management decisions that follow. What research avenues are you most excited about? What are the trends/future of GIS in your field? GLANSIS has always relied on map data as a core component of the information we serve to researchers and the public, but one new aspect of GIS we're beginning to experiment with more is ArcGIS StoryMaps. I love being able to display maps alongside other types of media to create an interactive narrative or tutorial. Our latest StoryMap is a guide to using the GLANSIS Map Explorer, which demonstrates how to use the tool as a built-in data visualizer or download the raw data to use in a GIS program of your choice. We're looking forward to making more!

So fine, let's make that happen. But, this is going to cause work in other areas to make language searching/filtering actually work well. Why is this the case? Metadata: Does Each Item Have a Language listed? Short answer: no. So this means for language to be a valuable search/filter option, items need to have a language included in their metadata. Many currently  don't. Most of these are very likely in English as they are geospatial data sources from various government entities in the US. But until we make sure and the change is made, the language for these items is essentially non-existent. So the people working with metadata would need to examine the language-less items to add the appropriate language to the item's metadata. This can be time consuming just because of the volume of items. But also, some items may be in a non-English language, but would the person looking at it know what that language is? So this is a lot more complicated than \"Look. Add Language. Look. Add Language\u2026..\" It's more like \"Look. English. Look. English. Look. What is that? Help!\" Collections: Should we add new content based on language? If we have language search/filter options, this gives us incentives to be sharing more diverse collections in terms of language. Are there strong non-English languages' collections for print maps? Perhaps we should be adding collections of Japanese maps, which have a few institutions with over 1,000 maps. Or should we look at maps with languages that are in the single digits to showcase some of our rarer languages? This creates work for our Collections folks. But of course, has implications for Metadata. Application Development: Of course, the people working on the development of our interface would need to be involved in order to make the language search/filter option happen. But how they need to do it has implications for metadata. So the moral of this story is that by just making one addition or change to the interface, even if it's deemed valuable, it can have a ripple effect of making work for others or open up the possibility for new projects (and thus, more work).

As the COVID-19 outbreak began, many researchers and bio-pharma around the world were working diligently to find a vaccine that potentially cures SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 global pandemic. Development of a successful vaccine would take several years and it is a tedious process that involves complex science, and thorough scrutiny by the government (i.e, authorizing body) before administering it to humans to prevent/cure disease. In-contrast to the traditional pipeline in  vaccine development, COVID-19 pandemic had led to an urgency in developing vaccines at record speed. In the past, not many people were interested in the vaccine development model/science and business until COVID-19 pandemic hit hard on humanitarian and economic development.  Figure 1: Vaccine Development Pipeline (source: theconservation.com) There are few organization/website that keep records of COVID-19 vaccine candidates including WHO COVID-19 Vaccine Landscape, Milken Institute COVID-19 vaccine tracker, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) Vaccine Center COVID-19 vaccine tracker and The New York Times Vaccine Tracker. However, these websites/tools lack information on scientific characteristics of vaccine candidates which is a key for analyzing biological components to understand the vaccines research. To overcome this, an interdisciplinary team from the University of Maryland Libraries and University of Notre Dame developed Vaccine Mapper that serves as a state-of-art web-based visual analytics platform to track COVID-19 vaccine candidates under study and their metadata analysis. The Vaccine Mapper, a data-discovery tool that features location of vaccine developers around the world with the key scientific information on their vaccine design, progress and other information. It was first launched to the public on May 20, 2020 that covered around 100 CVOID-19 vaccine candidates at different clinical stages.To date, the tool has tracked 284 candidates, for which many of them are still under study and only a handful of them are approved for emergency use. The team periodically collects information on vaccine candidates from various public sources to update the tool as appropriate. Figure 2: Vaccine Mapper- Vaccine Candidates page The Vaccine Mapper's record shows that there has been a huge diversity of vaccine candidates in development for a single disease that differ in terms of their development platforms, delivery systems, co-administered adjuvants, route of administration and manufacturing requirements. This record number of vaccine candidates provides one of a kind opportunity to determine the state of vaccine science, compare diverse vaccine development strategies, and identify emerging innovations as well as knowledge gaps in the field. The Vaccine Mapper has two major interfaces: Vaccine Candidates (landing page) and Vaccine Design. The landing page has a map showing location of al COVID-19 vaccine developers globally, chart showing candidate's development stages, list of developers that are awarded Operation Warp Speed, candidates publication where applicable etc. Whereas, Vaccine Design tab emphasis on vaccine development platform, delivery system and delivery route with graphs and charts.  Figure 3: VaccineMapper: Vaccine Design page This tool is user-friendly and allows audiences to discover information on COVID-19 vaccine candidates and their biological characteristics. The mapper features essential information products like, maps, graphs, charts and lists that are interactively linked to allow users to filter data to get the answers they want. For example, within the Vaccine Design tab, if a user selects the section of the pie chart showing mRNA under the vaccine development platform that automatically refines charts for the vaccine delivery system and routes (Fig. 4).  Figure 4: VaccineMapper: Vaccine Design parameter filtering This web tool was built using ArcGIS Online Dashboard- a cloud geospatial infrastructure powered by ESRI that supports location-based analytics using interactive data visualizations.

Connectivity is surging forward not quite to meet that need, but pretty fast by bureaucratic standards.

If you are like me, you liked how Esri's Classic Story Maps allowed you to upload an entire csv of points with image urls to create  a data-driven story map in one quick step without having to do this point-by-point. You may have agonized over this process in the newer version and you might be unaware that, by implementing a few extra steps using ArcGIS Desktop, you can also do this with the newer version. In the post that follows, I will walk you through the steps involved so that you can create a data-driven tour in ArcGIS StoryMaps using a csv spreadsheet and a folder of downloaded images. For this task, you will need: 1. ArcGIS Desktop 2. ArcGIS Online 3. A csv spreadsheet containing point names, descriptions, image names, and coordinate data 4. A folder containing the images you want to use Step One: Download the Data You can download a folder containing a sample spreadsheet and images by clicking here. Save this folder to your desktop as shown below. Notice that the csv contains a column with image names that match the jpg files in the images folder.  Step Two: Open CSV in ArcGIS Desktop as XY Data Now open ArcGIS Desktop and click File &gt; Add Data &gt; Add XY Data as shown below.  Next, fill in the dialog box as shown below at left. Browse for the iowa_cities.csv in the folder you downloaded to your desktop and use this as the input table. For the X Field, make sure you have selected the \"long\" column from the table. Likewise, for the Y Field, make sure you have selected the \"lat\" column from the table. Most importantly, you need to designate the coordinate system of the input coordinates by clicking \"Edit\" and searching for \"4326\" or WGS 1984.  You should now see the points in your map window. Add a basemap and confirm that the points correspond to the correct Iowa cities. Now we need to store these points in a geodatabase. Step Three: Export Points to a Geodatabase First, open ArcCatalog and connect to a folder where you would like to create a new file geodatabase. I am connecting to the folder that we saved to Desktop. Now, right click this folder and click New &gt; File Geodatabase, as shown below. Rename this geodatabase IowaCities.gdb.   Now, right click iowa_cities.csv Events in the Table of Contents and click Data &gt; Export Data. In the dialog box that opens, in the text box under the output feature class options, add the path to your new geodatabase and a name for the new feature class that will go there. For example: C:\\Users yourusername\\Desktop\\arcgis-storymap-data- main\\IowaCities.gdb\\iowa_cities. Add the exported feature class to your map. Step Four: Enable Attachments Next, search for and open a tool called \"Enable Attachments.\" Add the new iowa_cities points feature class from the new geodatabase as the input dataset as shown below. Click OK and wait for processing to complete.  Step Five: Generate an Attachment Match Table Now, find and open another tool called \"Generate Attachment Match Table.\" The input dataset is your iowa_cities feature class from the geodatabase. The input folder refers to the folder where the images are stored. We saved this to our desktop at the beginning. The output match table is the name of the table we will create with this tool. I am calling this \"iowa_cities_match_table.\" Make sure to save this in the geodatabase. Finally, the key field is the column from the input dataset containing all of the image names corresponding to those in the image folder. Have a look at the screenshot below for help. Click OK when ready.  Step Six: Add Attachments Now we are ready to add the images from our image folder as attachments to the appropriate points. Search for and open the \"Add Attachments\" tool and fill out the dialog box as follows. The input dataset is your iowa_cities feature class from the geodatabase. The input join field is the numeric id column from the input dataset. The match table is the table you created in the preceding step. The match join field refers to the matching numeric id column from the match table. The match path field is the name of the column in the match table containing the names of the images to be attached from the image folder. Finally, the working folder is the path to the desktop folder where all of the images are saved. Click OK.  Step Seven: Publish Points as a Service on ArcGIS Online  Important: You must make sure your Table of Contents contains only the points, attach table, and match table as shown in the image at right. All other data, including basemaps, must be removed before this step. Save. Click File &gt; Sign In\u2026 and complete the sign in dialogue. Once signed in, return to ArcGIS Desktop and click File &gt; Share As &gt; Service\u2026 and then click Publish a service &gt; Next. Name the service \"Iowa_Cities_Sample\" and click Continue. In the dialog box that follows, you need to click the \"Item Description\" tab and add a summary and tags. For summary, you can just input \"A sample of points with batch attached media.\" For tags, input \"Iowa cities.\" Now click \"Publish\" as shown in the following image.  If this doesn't work, you can click \"Analyze\" to get a report of any problems. You may need to open a new map with only the necessary data before you attempt to publish a service. Step Eight: Publish an ArcGIS StoryMap Tour from the Published ArcGIS Online Feature Service If you are able to publish the data successfully, navigate to the ArcGIS StoryMaps sign in page and sign in. Click New story &gt; Start from scratch. Give your story map a title and a subtitle. Then, click the + button next to \"Tell your story\u2026\" and click Map tour. You will see three options. Choose \"Start with a feature service\" and select the \"Iowa_Cities_Sample\" feature service you just published. Once you have done this, you should notice that your points have been added along with the associated images, as shown below.  Also notice how the story map automatically fills out the sidebar with the data from the name and description columns.  Admittedly, this is a bit of work for only six points, but you can see how this process would be helpful if you had a prepared spreadsheet with many points and did not want to add this content point-by-point. I hope this post saves you the hours of rummaging through GIS help pages that I subjected myself to before finding this solution.

This doesn't always result in interface issues. For example, at our most recent sprint, we put forward the challenge of finding maps of countries in their native language. This was used to test the new language facet. But it's revealed that we don't seem to have maps of several countries in their native language. China in Chinese  being very prominently absent.

An automated checker found some of the colors used to have concerns with contrast. So the color scheme was updated to give better contrast! So what do we do with all this info? Well, anything that is an outright interface problem gets reported as something needing fixed. Anything that's deemed something we want to do differently (like perhaps we want to move the order the facets are listed in), we send that forward for future development. Sometimes, this needs to be discussed more broadly if there are implications for other groups.

The Wabash River Basin, which covers most of Indiana and adjacent portions of Illinois and Ohio, was highly prone to flooding before this time. A 1933 report by the United States House Committee on Harbors and Rivers estimated the annual average cost of flood damage in the basin  at $2,000,000 (roughly equivalent to $60,000,000 today) (page 9). The creation of Lake Monroe formed part of a basin-wide solution. </p> <p></p> <p>Comparison of topographic map from 1975 study with the United States Geological Survey\u2019s 1947 7.5-minute series topographic map of \u201cAllens Creek Quadrangle, Indiana (Monroe County).\u201d Although the lake helped with regional flooding issues, by the early 1970s, several local problems began to emerge. Lake Monroe had become a valuable water source for the growing Bloomington and Bedford communities. It also served as a major center of commerce due to its attractiveness as a tourist and recreation site, which in turn increased demand for building residential and commercial developments in the area. The popularity of the lake raised concerns that human activities would accelerate its eutrophication and that \u201cthe usual resultant problems of prolific weed and algal growth, deteriorating fisheries, impaired water quality, and sediment infilling\u201d would pose serious threats to the lake (Gray, et al., page 10). To better assess these issues, a land suitability study was designed \u201cto provide a source of reliable information regarding the geology, ecology, land use, and institutional arrangements in the Lake Monroe Region\u201d(Gray, et al., page i). The study involved over a dozen government organizations at the local, state, and federal level, as well as two corporations (Cook and Caslon Development), and was carried out by 21 Indiana University faculty members representing the Indiana Geological Survey, School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Department of Zoology, Department of Geography, and the School of Law. The result of the study was a multidisciplinary 460-page report accompanied by four folded maps, including the one featured here showing the \u201cintricate topography\u201d of the Lake Monroe watershed with its \u201cmany interlacing ridges and ravines\u201d (Gray, et al., page 27).

This results in negative effects on our waterways and coastal waters not to mention decreased capacity for producing food and other agricultural products. This trend was seen decades ago by the USDA Soil Conservation Service. In response, the Service created and published county maps that colorfully delineated prime and unique farmland. The purpose was to help city planning and other officials understand the high quality land resources in their area [and thereby avoid  if possible in future urban growth projects]. As the multi-year project unfurled, it prioritized counties experiencing rapid land use change. Map production continued into the early 1980s, but then took a turn for the worse. The project fell far short of the intended 1,200 counties - perhaps the recession of the early 1980s had something to do with that. And somehow the maps also escaped widespread distribution through the Federal Library Depository network. Most maps produced by Federal government agencies are widely distributed and one can expect hundreds of copies to be available in libraries across the country. These maps, however, remained fairly obscure with just a few counties available in scattered collections. Recently the Big Ten Academic Alliance member libraries came to realize that each institution owned only parts of the collection. Through the Geospatial Information Network they planned a project to scan and make available online each library\u2019s collection, indexing them all together in the Big Ten Geoportal. So far 36 counties in Michigan have been submitted, with more expected in the future from other states.

This is a common problem for geospatial data! If you work with geodatabases but sometimes share data in alternate file formats, this post is especially for you. Geodatabases are popular among GIS researchers, but there are a limited number of software in which they can be opened. Because of this, it is a common practice to convert feature classes into shapefiles when archiving or sharing data. Shapefiles have substantial limitations, however, which can lead to loss of  data and functionality during file conversion. You may have come across the truncation (and frustration) that can result from the 10 character limit on field names. There are many other limitations shapefiles have that are more difficult to notice, including limitations on the length of text fields and lack of support for time within date fields. It is easy to unintentionally alter a dataset while trying to make it accessible to a broader audience!  Caption: The tables in this figure show what can happen if you convert a date field from a geodatabase into a shapefile. Alt Text: Geodatabases are able to include time within date fields, while shapefiles can only represent day, month, and year. In the example, hours, minutes, and seconds have been removed from the shapefile version of the date field. Also, the field name in the geodatabase (\"date_sampling_test\") has been truncated to 10 characters (\"date_sampl\") in the shapefile version. The Geospatial Data Curation Toolkit helps with this and other challenges that arise when archiving data. The GeodatabasetoShapefileWarnings tool generates a report describing what will be lost when converting data layers between geodatabase and shapefile formats. The toolkit also includes tools to:  * create an inventory of the data layers and fields in geodatabases  * check for missing file extensions and whether all shapefiles in a folder use the same projection The toolkit is available on GitHub! You can download the files by clicking on the green \"Code\" button and choosing \"Download Zip.\" You will also find instructions about how to run the tools, a more detailed description of what they do, and sample reports. Feel free to use, share, and make derivatives!

My name is Takuma Goto, and I am a 4th year OSU student majoring in Statistics and Spanish. As my name suggests, I am ethnically Japanese, and thanks to my parents' efforts, I understand Japanese as well as English. This has given me the opportunity to work with the East Asian Studies Unit alongside Geology and GIS librarians on a Japanese maps project at the library. My work is part of a larger project to surface culturally diverse materials for teaching and learning and identify materials for potential digitization and cataloging on the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal. With this blog, I'd like to share some of my preliminary findings! </p> <p></p> <p>Pie chart Showing the Location of Japanese Maps in the University Library System *** *</p> <p>## </p> <p>*Where are the maps \u2013 and how old are they?</p> <ul> <li>The Japanese Maps collection consists of over 2500 maps either published in Japan, in Japanese, or featuring the Japanese islands or colonized territories of the Japanese empire. During my first weeks on the job, I created a couple of pie charts that break down this extensive collection according to details such as when they were published and where they are stored in the library system. The vast majority of these are listed in OSU's library catalog at go.osu.edu/JapaneseMaps. As shown in the chart above, about two-thirds can be found in the Thompson Library's Map Room, and roughly one-third are circulating in the Geology Library in Orton Hall. These latter maps contain information relating to Japanese land features and seismological interests. One of our oldest maps, Fujimi j\u016bsansh\u016b yochi zenzu (\u51a8\u58eb\u898b\u5341\u4e09\u5dde\u8f3f\u5730\u5168\u5716, or roughly translated, A Complete Map of the 13 Provinces Overlooking Mount Fuji), published in 1842, can be found in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library. In addition, roughly three dozen Japanese maps are dispersed in places like the Architecture Library, the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum (BICLM), the Thompson stacks, and the University Depository. Often targeting children, the maps at BICLM are especially colorful and often include interesting graphics representing different cultures and landmarks. ***</li> </ul> <p>*</p> <p>### </p> <p>*Breakdown of Maps by Decade</p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Pie chart Showing the Distribution of Japanese Maps by Decade As suggested in my second chart above, the map collection varies widely in scope and size. While most of the maps were published after World War II, around 400 of them are from the pre-war era and feature kanji in traditional Chinese (ky\u016bjitai). In addition, some of the pre-war maps focus on Northeast China and other territories that were occupied by Imperial Japan. Other types of maps include transportation maps, like of the entire subway system in Japan, and general tourist brochures from the 1990s featuring major cities like Tokyo.</p> <p>### </p> <p>*The Dainihon k\u014dtei \u014dezu: an Edo Travel Map Facsimile (ca. 1840s)</p> <ul> <li>Originally published in 1843, theDainihon k\u014dtei \u014dezu (\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u884c\u7a0b\u5927\u7e6a\u5716 transl.: Great Japanese Travel Map ) mapped the country of Japan.

The comparison surfaces the ahistoricity of Google's interface as well as its slightly different prioritization of markers for commercial interests over public institutions and churches. Less frequently noticed is the fact that north is actually to the right in the historical map.

They are part of an effort to document the spatial distribution and extent of a mechanism widely understood to be a root cause of ongoing racial segregation and wealth inequality. They make visible these efforts to maintain racially divided access to property and wealth, which were long concealed in the extended pages of local records. What BTAA Library submitted the item?  * University of Iowa Interesting tidbits *** *  * An outgrowth of  the Mapping Prejudice project initiated at the University of Minnesota  * The uneven digitization of property records including racial restrictions presented unique impediments to reproducing the research in Greater St. Louis, Missouri  * The expansion of private racial restrictions in the St. Louis region were mapped from the late nineteenth century to their decline with Shelley v Kraemer in 1948  * Mapping this quantity of data in interactive format also presented issues with responsiveness that were solved by converting the geojson polygon data to vector tiles  * Such restrictions calcified notions about racial homogeneity and property value in US cities that have continued to impact educational opportunity, economic mobility, and intergenerational wealth Inspired by the work of researchers and community activists in Minneapolis (Mapping Prejudice) and Seattle (Segregated Seattle), we set out to document the use of racial restrictions on property in St. Louis in the first half of the 20th century. Such restrictions are widely understood to constitute the root cause of racial segregation and lasting disparities in racial wealth, and the foundation of local and federal policies that succeeded them. And yet, because the restrictions themselves are buried in local property records, they have proven difficult to document. </p> <p></p> <p>St. Louis Deed Book 1121-525 (1893), p3. In some settings (including Minneapolis) the digitization of records has enabled \"distant reading\" through optical character recognition. In St. Louis City and St. Louis County, however, the records are unevenly digitized and\u2014for the era of private restriction\u2014largely handwritten. So we needed a different research strategy. We were able to exploit a wrinkle in local recording conventions: In Missouri, as in a few other settings, county recorders not only documented restrictions in individual deeds, but also required developers and realtors to file \"master agreements\" covering entire subdivisions or neighborhoods. In both St. Louis and St. Louis County, such agreements are filed with a regular run of deed records or plat maps. Additionally, they are indexed separately from the \"grantor and grantee\" index that otherwise governs the organization of deed books. In St. Louis City, this was by one of the local title companies; in St. Louis County this was by the recorder themselves. </p> <p></p> <p>Crestwood (1928), Plat Book 26-25 In each jurisdiction, we collected the effective date, language, terms, and scope of each restrictive indenture or agreement. Using the current county assessor or recorder shapefile of property parcels, we used stable legal descriptions (common to historical and current records) to match historical restrictions to current parcels. This enabled us to map the trajectory and reach of private racial restrictions, from their earliest iterations in the late nineteenth century, through the explosion of their use in response to the First and Second Great Migrations (especially during the housing boom of the 1920s), to the abrupt decline in the practice after the Supreme Court decision in Shelley v Kraemer (1948). </p> <p></p> <p>Racial Restrictions in Greater St. Louis, 1870 - 1952 Starting from these linked data in shapefile format, we endeavored to build an interactive map of the nearly 100,000 restricted parcels in St. Louis and St. Louis County. Mapping such a large quantity of data proved initially to be a challenge. Early efforts at producing an interactive map using Leaflet JS to pull from large files in GeoJSON format resulted in slow loading and sluggish map responsivity to the interactive elements, like the time slider, hover-activated tooltip, layer control, and zoom button. To avoid having to separate the map into city and county partitions, we opted to convert the GeoJSON data into vector tiles and handle the resulting tile set with another open-source map-oriented JavaScript library, MapLibre GL JS. With vector tiles, the map can shed unseen data and simplify polygons at smaller map scales. This allowed us to plot the full collection of restricted private parcel data without crashing the application, thereby providing the public with an uncomplicated visual account of racial segregation in Greater St. Louis that would otherwise remain concealed in overwhelming volumes of handwritten deeds and subdivision agreements. </p> <p></p> <p>Real Estate Advertisement Promoting \"Careful Restrictions\" and \"Desirable Neighbors\" These private restrictions were an important source of segregation and housing occupancy in their own right, setting the terms of racial occupancy in northern and border cities across a half century of dramatic urbanization and migration. It also served as the foundation for durable inequalities. In part, this was because its base assumptions\u2014about property values, land use, and neighborhood homogeneity\u2014were emulated and entrenched by local zoning and federal housing policies. In part, this was because, in the American context especially, so much else\u2014including educational opportunity, economic mobility, and intergenerational wealth\u2014flowed from those housing investments.

I can remember a piece where I inkjet-printed a map of the local area onto printmaking paper and then screen printed an image on top that mixed the two together to obscure an understanding of either image. The image on top was an abstracted line drawing of a homeless person who lived near campus. I was trying to make a statement about how many of the individuals who are homeless disappear into the space around them to most people who pass by. Through undergraduate and graduate studies, I continued to make one-off projects here and there that referenced maps and mapping imagery. It wasn't until 2019 that I started to create more prolonged projects using mapping imagery. Since then I have been working on a number of series that explore mapping imagery in different formats and directions.</p> <p>### </p> <p>Old Man\u2019s Proposition  --- Figure 1: *Old Man's Proposition * ; 32\"x20\", mixed media collage, 2020; a mixed media collage that references both congressional district mapping and constellation creation to reference the narratives we create to understand mapping imagery.</p> <p>### </p> <p>Is there a specific type of map that you use in your work? What format of maps do you use, such as print or digital? *Matt * : There is not a specific type of map that I use in my work. My work is more about approaching the use of maps and mapping imagery through different relational and philosophical aspects. One book that heavily influenced some of my research is Mark Monmonier's \"How to Lie with Maps Vol. 3.\" The general public takes maps and the information they gain from them for granted and expect that the maps they reference will always be truthful. But the reality is that there is nothing that stops a map creator from giving people incorrect information other than their personal integrity. I find it fascinating that as a society and culture as a whole, maps have an innate sense of truth that cannot be questioned. Yet, as with so much information we are presented with on the internet, and in the daily course of life, we should naturally question it to make sure we are getting factual information. I find myself working with mostly digital versions of maps because it allows more flexibility in how I approach using them in my studio practice. But that being said, many of the digital versions of the maps I reference are from photographs or scans of printed maps throughout history.</p> <p>### </p> <p>Where do you acquire maps? What software do you use to process them? Does a data/map discovery portal like the BTAA Geoportal play a significant role in finding and selecting maps for your work? *Matt * : I acquire maps for my work through various sources. Alongside utilizing the University of Maryland collection, I search different online databases and have a small collection of my own atlases that I have purchased at different points in time. Most of my work involves using Adobe Illustrator to process the aspects of the maps that I want to directly reference in my pieces. Using illustrator to create files based on different graphic elements allows me flexibility in thinking about what process I might use for outputting the information. An Illustrator file can allow me to print a film of a file, but also output the file through a vinyl cutter, laser cutter, or other new digital tools for different applications. I have not used many data/map discovery portals for my research but that is not to say I will not. Currently I am focused on working through the University of Maryland collection, but I can see myself utilizing the BTAA Geoportal in the future.</p> <p>### </p> <p>DALL.E Gromatici #1  --- Figure 2: *DALL.E Gromatici #1 * ; 14\"x21\", cyanotype, 2023; a cyanotype inspired by a DALL.E prompt while referencing the historical use of cyanotypes for making maps in the late 19th century.</p> <p>### </p> <p>How do you publicize your work to ensure that a broader audience can benefit from it? *Matt * : I have exhibitions of my work in galleries and art spaces a few times a year. For example, I had an exhibition this past April at the Athenaeum in Alexandria, Virginia. I have two more solo exhibitions planned for 2023 as well as one planned for early 2024. I am also exhibiting in different group exhibitions throughout the year as I get my works accepted into them. Beyond physical exhibitions, I have a website I post my work onto and I am active in the use of different social media platforms, like instagram, where I post images of my process and works along with descriptions of the pieces.</p> <p>### </p> <p>Could you please briefly describe your current project and how you plan to utilize the map collection at UMD Libraries? *Matt * : My current project with the University of Maryland map collection is funded through the Clarvit Research Fellowship through the Department of Art in the College of Arts and Humanities at UMD. For my research I am working through the UMD collection looking for interesting graphic elements in the maps. I will be documenting the elements and creating a visual library for myself that will contain all the graphic elements. With this visual library I will use the elements as layered aspects of new prints and paintings that will work towards creating pieces that are abstract in nature but recognizable through their mapping elements. In essence the goal is to make works that seem understandable because of the recognizable nature of the mapping graphics, but through layering, texture, and color the works will not be readable as maps. Instead they will have the feeling of maps, but be too abstract to give the viewer the typically easy understanding of information that maps offer.</p> <p>### </p> <p>Balancing Act  --- Figure 3: *Balancing Act ; * 32\" x19\", mixed media collage, 2021</p> <p>### </p> <p>Any additional interesting things that you would like to share about your project/map work etc? Matt * : Mainly that I hope to dive deeper into the history of maps and the processes used for their creation. It was only recently that I discovered that the use of the photographic cyanotype process was used in the creation of maps starting in the late 19th century. The build upon the history of the different forms maps have come in, but also relates to our use of the term \"blue prints\" which is fascinating.This was originally posted on blogger here*.</p>","tags":["art","interview","Maryland","cartography","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2023/01/31/monthly-program-update/","title":"Monthly program update","text":""},{"location":"blog/2016/03/01/cic-geospatial-data-discovery-project-update-march-2016/","title":"CIC Geospatial Data Discovery Project Update March 2016","text":""},{"location":"blog/2016/03/01/cic-geospatial-data-discovery-project-update-march-2016/#march-activities","title":"March Activities","text":""},{"location":"blog/2016/03/01/cic-geospatial-data-discovery-project-update-march-2016/#cic-geospatial-task-force-meetings","title":"CIC Geospatial Task Force Meetings","text":"<p>Monthly, virtual meetings of the CIC Geospatial Task Force (members from all participant institutions).

The code sprint resulted in a major new feature that displays standards based XML metadata as HTML in the interface, an enhancement that has been requested by many GeoBlacklight users.</p> <p>The BTAA Application Developer directly contributed to a number of behind the scenes minor code changes, including a Leaflet update and a webkit deprecation. The Project Metadata Coordinator created and distributed a survey to six institutions hosting or developing a GeoBlacklight instance with questions about their technology architecture, project structure and scope, and metadata workflows. Both of the BTAA participants spent considerable time collaborating with NYU and Princeton on explorations of two larger developments initiated during the sprint: the possibility of migrating to a DCAT based metadata schema and improving the usability of the map search feature.

The new plan incorporates content from all of the committees and spreads their submissions out over the year. A new Twitter account was also set up, and the Product Owner will share blog posts via this platform.</p> <p>The Product Owner and the Application Developer participated in the GeoBlacklight Winter Codesprint. The codesprint resulted in GeoBlacklight 2.0, a major release. This version was necessary in order to stay current with the underlying framework, Blacklight, which recently upgraded to its own version 7.0. Many of the changes are behind the scenes (Bootstrap, Solr, and Rails) and may not be noticeable to the user. However, several bug fixes and enhancements were included in GeoBlacklight 2.0 that will improve user experience:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An old     issue     (identified in 2015!) was finally addressed that implements     spatial relevance algorithms in the map search. This means that     items that most closely fit the selected map extent will rise to     the top of the search results. The BTAA Interface Committee had     identified this as a major priority for this sprint, and our     Application Developer's work on this was essential to solving this     challenging issue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Two enhancements were added that will enable multipart items. This     is advantageous, because we have held off on including individual     pages from an atlas or map series, as having hundreds of records     with nearly identical metadata would clutter the search interface.     The first enhancement is a method for handling parent-child     records that suppresses child records in a search query. For     example, an atlas with hundreds of records representing individual     pages would only show up once in the search results. The child     pages will only be accessible from the parent record page. The     second enhancement is an improvement to the display of digital     index maps that allow users to navigate by map directly to a page     in an atlas or a sheet in a map series.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/01/01/project-update-january-2019/#activities","title":"Activities","text":""},{"location":"blog/2019/01/01/project-update-january-2019/#january-2019-statistics","title":"January 2019 Statistics","text":"<ul> <li>Total records: 18,195</li> <li>New records in January: 769</li> <li>Pageviews: 5336 </li> <li>Sessions: 695</li> <li>Unique users: 460</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/01/01/project-update-january-2019/#application-development","title":"Application Development","text":"<ul> <li> <p>The Application Developer was successfully migrated to a new role as     an independent contractor on the project.</p> </li> <li> <p>GeoBlacklight Winter     Codesprint.

We also advised new attendees about potential collaborative efforts and how they might be able to implement parts of a spatial data infrastructure, particularly by using a discovery application like GeoBlacklight.</p> <p>During the last week of February, the Application Developer completed their first codesprint for the project, which entails working as an independent contractor full time for one week per month. This codesprint was very productive and resulted in several bug fixes, testing and code improvements, as well as implementations of automated processes. The automations were an especially welcome enhancement, as the reduced schedule of the Application Developer meant these would not get performed regularly otherwise.</p> <p>Our Wisconsin Task Force member reached a major milestone this month when they were finally able to make all of their county GIS data dating back to 2014 freely open to the public. This means that over 1,200 previously restricted records were made public and added to our geoportal collection, bringing our total number of records very close to 20,000.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/02/01/project-update-february-2019/#activities","title":"Activities","text":"<p>February 2019 Statistics</p> <p>Total records: 19,899 New records in January: 1704 Pageviews: 5046 Sessions: 883  Unique users: 586</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/02/01/project-update-february-2019/#application-development","title":"Application Development","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Automation - results emailed to staff</p> <ul> <li> <p>Thumbnail     Harvesting     (nightly)</p> </li> <li> <p>Checking broken     links     (monthly)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Testing and code improvements</p> <ul> <li> <p>CircleCI Continuous     Integration</p> </li> <li> <p>Rubocop     and DotEnv     Implemented -     makes Ruby code more consistent</p> </li> <li> <p>Ruby 2.6.1     Upgrade -     This upgrade helped fix a potential security     vulnerability     issue related to Bootstrap and SASS file processing within the     project.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Bug Fixes</p> <ul> <li> <p>Leaflet Fullscreen     Toggle -     now working for all preview items</p> </li> <li> <p>Sidebar Map     Extent -     now works for world extents</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove Bookmarks Nav     Link -     removed unnecessary menu link</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Upgrade to GeoBlacklight v2.0: This will be a significant effort.

The site was upgraded to GeoBlacklight 2.0 which required new versions of Solr (the index) and Bootstrap, (HTML, CSS, and JS library that controls visual aspects, such as layout and font). The Solr upgrade process involved working with the Library Web Development department to install new Solr 7.7 cores, and with the Metadata Coordinator to republish all of the geoportal's records. The Bootstrap upgrade required the Application Developer to comb through the code and manually fix issues with new variable names and to reapply custom color and spacing designs. Additionally, several features, such as Autosuggest and the Advanced Search plugin, needed troubleshooting in order to continue functioning properly in the new version.</p> <p>Although much of the work was \"behind the scenes,\" the upgraded geoportal brought new features that will improve user experience. The first is a major improvement to the map search algorithm that now prioritizes \"best fit\" for items that have bounding boxes close to the map extent. The second is the implementation of a field that flags records to be hidden from a search. This is useful for multipart items with very similar metadata. Users will see a parent record in search results and then access the children via an index map or the Related Records widget. The field is also useful for hiding records that we want to keep, such as those with broken access links, indicating that the source host is updating the dataset or has retired it.</p> <p>The project has continued to steadily grow and reached new landmarks this month. After an influx of county datasets from Wisconsin and Ohio, the geoportal hit a new threshold of 20,000 records, and Google Analytics showed that March 2019 featured the highest number of unique users (771) to date. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#activities","title":"Activities","text":"<p>March 2019 Statistics</p> <ul> <li>Total records: 20,148 </li> <li>New records in March: 249</li> <li>Pageviews: 6442</li> <li>Sessions: 1056</li> <li>Unique users: 771</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#application-development","title":"Application Development","text":"<ul> <li>Upgraded to GeoBlacklight version 2.0</li> <li>Upgraded Apache Solr to version 7.7</li> <li>Improved the Related Items layout on the item view page</li> <li>Made the static pages load more efficiently with a rake task</li> <li>Updated Rails to address a security vulnerability</li> <li>Create position description for full time application developer</li> <li>Upgrade to Rails 5.2</li> <li>Upgrade Sidecar images plugin for Rails 5.2</li> <li>Explore a dedicated IIIF server for all images</li> <li>Implement a IIIF viewer that handles multiple images</li> <li>Recommended moving blog to a 3rd party platform</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#collections","title":"Collections","text":"<ul> <li>Added 36 new records from Wisconsin counties</li> <li>Added 78 new records from 3 Ohio counties</li> <li>Added 19 records from federal agency - US Army Corps of Engineers,     St. Paul District</li> <li>Updated collection level records with descriptions, place names, and     subjects</li> <li>Re-accessioned all ArcGIS records - 181 existing records retired;     151 new records added</li> <li>Cleaning up IIIF links for UMedia maps</li> <li>Developing workflow for defining relationships between multi-part     items, such as atlases</li> <li>Develop workflow for creating page level metadata (titles and     bounding boxes) for child records, such as pages in an atlas</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#coordination-and-documentation","title":"Coordination and Documentation","text":"<ul> <li>Q2 Bulletin listing activities from Q1 and visions for Q2 for each committee.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#committees-and-working-groups","title":"Committees and Working Groups","text":""},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#steering-committee","title":"Steering Committee","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Close Analytics Working Group</p> </li> <li> <p>Implement Analytics Working Group recommendations with a metadata     update for Tableau</p> </li> <li> <p>Charge an ArcGIS Organization working group to explore possibilities     for using this platform, such as shared geospatial web services or     data downloads</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#communications-committee","title":"Communications Committee","text":"<ul> <li>Blog post - Featured Collection: District of Columbia Open Data </li> <li>Blog post - Contributor Spotlight: University of Iowa</li> <li>Identify university websites where the geoportal has been listed</li> <li>Develop content for instructors to use when introducing students to     geoportal</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#collections-development-committee","title":"Collections Development Committee","text":"<ul> <li>Update Collections Strategy to include collection level records</li> <li>Write 10 highlighted collection blog posts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#interface-committee","title":"Interface Committee","text":"<ul> <li>Updated the About page</li> <li>Creating new guides for the Help page</li> <li>Updating the layout of the Help page</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#metadata-committee","title":"Metadata Committee","text":"<ul> <li>Created a screencast showing how to find and cite data from the     geoportal</li> <li>Create a tutorial aimed at data providers on creating discovery     metadata</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/03/01/project-update-march-2019/#slg-working-group","title":"SLG Working Group","text":"<ul> <li>Completed background documents to support the SLG project to gauge     interest in archiving plans:</li> <li>Completed a draft of Interview Questions for AULs and library deans</li> <li>Test interview questions with SLG members</li> <li>Schedule interviews at remaining institutions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2019/04/01/project-update-april-2019/","title":"Project Update: April 2019","text":""},{"location":"blog/2019/04/01/project-update-april-2019/#highlights","title":"Highlights","text":"<p>The committees made strides in their efforts to develop educational and promotional content for the geoportal.

This required a new metadata element, two new facets on the search interface, and a custom link access panel.

We worked with developers at the University of Michigan to newly create these Manifests and were able to add them for all of Michigan's 802 maps. We also discovered that the University of Minnesota's UMedia system already supported Manifests, and we were able to add them for all of Minnesota's 1045 UMedia map records.

Datasets\\, Maps) and by form (LOC Cartographic genres or datasets geometry). There are also new fields for Rights\\, Relationships\\, and File sizes.</p> <p>Many of these schema improvements came from customizations that the BTAA project already had in place. However\\, many other changes came from incorporating the needs of new GeoBlacklight adopters. A GeoBlacklight Metadata Interest Group is ongoing\\, led by the BTAA Project Manager\\, and will continue to assess and refine the schema as needed.</p> <p></p> <p>Statistics: Item Records</p> <ul> <li>Total Item Records</li> <li>45\\,018</li> <li>June 2021 actions</li> <li>Added 3360 records</li> <li>830 Hixson atlas pages for Michigan</li> <li>2466 PLSS Township plats for Michigan along with an index map</li> <li>Iowa Mining Interactive Map</li> <li>62 ArcGIS Hub records</li> <li>Retired 76 records ( ArcGIS Hub) </li> </ul> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Statistics: Geoportal &amp; Blog Users</p> <p>Geoportal &amp; Project Site* users for the months of June (2017-2021)</p> <p>*Blog\\, Help\\, Tutorials\\, Conference info</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Statistics: Top Pages in June</p> Top Viewed Collection Pages Top Viewed Item Pages Top Downloaded Items Wisconsin Historic Aerial Imagery Finder (Aerial Photos 1937-41) (216)General Land Office Township Plats: Michigan (174)+Russian Military Topographic Map Collection (91)*+Digital Sanborn Maps (Black &amp; White): All States, 1867-1970 (81)+ Historical Aerial Photography: Harford County, Maryland, 1957+--Remonumented Section Corners: Michigan (48) --Election Data (Wisconsin 2018 Wards): Wisconsin, 2012-2020 (41)*+ Historical Aerial Photography: Harford County, Maryland, 1957 (22) +--Bedrock geology of the Ely and Basswood Lake 30' x 60' quadrangles, northeast Minnesota, M-148 (20) +Remonumented Section Corners: Michigan (14) --Kent County Parcel Data: Grand Rapids, Michigan (14) +-- <p>* Google Ad Campaign item</p> <p>+  New to top pages</p> <p>-- Retired item</p> <p></p> <p>Activities: Application Development</p> <ul> <li>First round of interface improvements</li> <li>New homepage with map and text swapped</li> <li>Can scroll on map now</li> <li>Additional Aardvark metadata fields on item view pages</li> <li>New icons tied to \u201cResource Class\u201d instead of \u201cGeometry Type\u201d</li> <li>Gave a presentation about GEOMG to the GeoBlacklight Community</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Activities: Committees</p> <p>Metadata Committee</p> <p>Created documentation/FAQs for metadata decisions based upon recent sprints</p> <p>Decided to add a custom field to clarify confusing access disclaimers</p> <p>Plan to explore subject vocabularies to improve browsing and searching</p> <p>Collection Development Committee</p> <p>Carried out first Collections Sprint that looked at gaps in coverage for parcels\\, county boundaries\\, roads\\, landcover/land use\\, and LiDAR</p> <p>Compiled results of sprint</p> <p>Plan to develop recommendations for tagging these as foundational layers</p> <p>Communications Committee</p> <p>Conducted blog post sprint</p> <p>Sent out new template to Task Force for conducting interviews with campus faculty and staff that use geospatial resources</p> <p>Continuing selected ad campaigns</p> <p>Interface Committee</p> <p>Completed analysis of usability tests and finalized recommended actions to be undertaken by application developer</p> <p></p> <p>Activities: Working Groups</p> <ul> <li>Education Outreach Working Group (phase 2)</li> <li>Completed new tutorials</li> <li>Diverse Collections Working Group</li> <li>Developed framework  for defining next steps</li> <li>Assigned members to investigate selected areas</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>July : WAML/Magirt webinar presented by all committee chairs</p> <p>August: _  _New / Reorganized Committee chairs and members meet\\, including a new committee\\, called \u201cEducation Outreach\u201d.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2021/07/01/update_2021-07/","title":"Update 2021 07","text":"<p>Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project</p> <p>Project Update:  July 2021</p> <p>Table of Contents</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Project Highlight for July</p> <p>MAGIRT/WAML Webinar</p> <p>Seven project members co-presented a webinar titled \u201cBig Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data: innovation and collaboration\u201d for the map and geography professional organizations MAGIRT and WAML. </p> <p>The talk diverged from most of our previous presentations in that it focused on our current collaborative committee work more than the general project genesis and structure.

The primary goal has been to facilitate sharing metadata across institutions that have adopted GeoBlacklight. It uses GitHub as the sharing platform and includes metadata tools, best practices, and the GeoBlacklight schema documentation.</p> <p>Our initial participation in OpenGeoMetadata was hampered by the instability of the BTAA Geoportal\u2019s earliest GIS open data collections; it was impractical to share metadata records for open data items that were regularly retired and replaced. However, as our collection has grown, we have incorporated many resources from institutional repositories that feature quality metadata and stable access points. Examples of these records are found in our Libraries Geospatial Data Collection and our Libraries Historical Maps Collection.</p> <p>Therefore, in recent months, we have re-committed to sharing our metadata through OpenGeoMetadata and created repositories for each participating institution. These records have been picked up by other geoportals, including Princeton\u2019s Digital Maps &amp; Geospatial Data. In the future, we plan to share our curated resources that would be of interest to the wider community, including our Indigenous Lands collection.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2022/02/01/update_2022-02/","title":"Update 2022 02","text":""},{"location":"blog/2022/02/01/update_2022-02/#project-highlight-geoblacklight-february","title":"Project Highlight: \u2018GeoBlacklight February\u2019","text":"<p>The month of February always features two big events in the GeoBlacklight community: Geo4LibCamp and the Winter Community Sprint.</p> <p>Geo4LibCamp  was scaled back this year to a single \u201cCommunity Day.\u201d Members from the BTAA-GIN served on the planning committee and presented during the  lightning talks.</p> <p>The  GeoBlacklight bi-annual Community Sprints are hosted by BTAA-GIN staff.

Moreover, five contributors made their very first code commits to GeoBlacklight during this event. At the end, we heard positive feedback, including that it was welcoming, organized, and easy to find ways to contribute. Sentiments expressing desired changes were mainly around the technical difficulty of getting GeoBlacklight installed locally.

One effort was around the topic of  Language.</p> <p>Language has long been an optional field in the GeoBlacklight metadata schema, but was not being displayed in the interface anywhere. The Working Group recommended that the project ensure a language was assigned to each resource and to display it as a browseable facet.</p> <p>The Metadata Committee held a sprint that included attention on filling in missing language values.

Range Shifts Predicted with Climate Change in a Common North American Songbird","text":"<p>Susan Reed, Indiana University Bloomington</p> <p>With a net loss of 3 billion North American birds since 1970, and 2.5 billion being native migratory birds, it is critical to investigate population dynamics and threats to species that impact abundance 1 and geographic distribution across space and time. Predicting species range in response to variation in climate is a goal shared among the fields of both conservation and evolutionary ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are visual representations of simulated spatial and temporal patterns of a species in response to predictor variables (PVs), making them useful tools for predicting a species\u2019 range for extrapolated future climate scenarios. As rapid environmental change is experienced, animals must adapt to changes in their environment at a minimum of the same rate, lest they risk extinction. Range shifts and adjustments in movement strategies are mechanism of coping with climate change, and SDMs give insight into how these mechanisms may play out in natural populations\u2014information that may be used to forecast population dynamics and persistence. A better understanding of where, when, and how species distributions are shaped provides valuable information to conservation practitioners, evolutionary ecologists, and policy makers for decision-making regarding habitat and species management. Here, I use ArcGIS Pro2 software to demonstrate SDMs of climate niches for a common migratory North American songbird, the slate-colored dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), utilizing contemporary and extrapolated climate scenarios to model changes in its range as it experiences climate change.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#2-estimating-urban-rooftop-solar-power-production-potential-in-chicago","title":"2.

Deep learning-based tree species identification using UAV RGB images*","text":"<p>Yunmei Huang, Purdue University</p> <p>Information at the species level is necessary for precision forest management and biodiversity conservation. However, it remains a challenging task with traditional remote sensing techniques because of the limit in imaging resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, are getting more attentions for their low-cost and high-resolution advantages. However, most of the studies focusing on UAVs images for tree species identification are based on multispectral, hyperspectral images or combined with LiDAR data. The gap exists in using UAVs RGB data to identify tree species at the stand-level in forests with various species, especially for temperate forests. In this study, we built a  species dataset using high-resolution canopy images (3-5 centimeters)  collected by drones from different seasons. Transfer learning techniques were used to test the performance on specie identification using ResNet18, YOLOv5, and EffcientNetb0, which achieved accuracies above 98% among 4 species including northern red oak, black cherry, and white oak. Testing how flight height affects species classification using RGB images from different flight altitudes is one of the projects we are working on. Tree species identification among more species and individual tree detection from natural forests will be part of our future work.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#5-how-would-ses-and-neighborhood-environment-influence-individuals-physical-inactivity-and-psychological-distress-in-the-city-of-chicago","title":"5.

Planners of the system routed some highways, often purposely, through vulnerable and deprived neighborhoods occupied by people of color. Once thriving and full neighborhoods, these neighborhoods were split and, in some cases, even fully demolished for these urban highways. This caused an economic downturn in many of these neighborhoods that lasts until the present day. Remaining residents still live with the negative consequences of these highways, including disconnections, poor air quality, noise and road trauma.

Although it is widely documented that internet availability is inconsistent across rural areas, pockets of neighborhoods in urban areas also lack access. We used the example of Milwaukee, Wisconsin a historically segregated city to show how Federally sanctioned residential segregation in the 1930\u2019s is still reflected in health inequities in socioeconomic health metrics today. We used ArcGIS Pro to map several community socioeconomic metrics such as children in poverty, homeownership rates, and those who have completed high school, as well as historically redlined neighborhoods, against access to high-speed broadband to show the spatial patterns. We then transformed these maps into several GIFs, shared in an article on the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps website and social media platforms, to help users better overlay the different metrics. We find, unsurprisingly, that census tracts with lower percentages of broadband access are correlated with those in which more children live in poverty, fewer individuals own their homes or graduated high school, and were more likely to be redlined in the past. These findings highlight the existence of digital redlining and point to the need to reduce the inequity in broadband access to avoid further harm to communities experiencing disinvestment. </p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#overcoming-the-challenges-of-developing-a-geospatial-database-for-longitudinal-study-of-urban-childhood-obesity","title":"Overcoming the challenges of developing a geospatial database for longitudinal study of urban childhood obesity","text":"<p>David Tulloch, Rutgers University; Kristen Lloyd, Rutgers University; Michael Yedidia, Rutgers University; Derek Delia, Rutgers University; Robin DeWeese, Arizona State University; Francesco Acciai, Arizona State University; Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, Arizona State University</p> <p>Childhood obesity is a complex problem to which a child's environment contributes significantly. Translating the dynamic urban realities of both the food environment and physical activity (PA) environment into consistently measurable variables is a challenging GIS problem, especially in cities with limited municipal data infrastructure. Using proximity as an indicator of access, we created an unique longitudinal dataset for this project which led to a variety of important findings about childhood obesity and access to parks and corner stores, perceptions about safety impacting walkability, and the value of developing an early habit of walking or biking to school. Since 2008, our research team built a routinely updated database representing the dynamic food environment of Camden, Newark, New Brunswick and Trenton, New Jersey. Updates included mapping corner stores, groceries, fruit and vegetable store, bakeries, butchers, supermarkets, as well as fast-food and full-service restaurants. While general food outlet data is acquired from various sources, to be valid each year\u2019s entry needs to be checked with direct contact and using supplementary information sources (e.g. external locational data). Simultaneously, the team mapped the physical activity environment, including parks and PA facilities (like gyms). The database also includes upgrades to community PA features (like parks, trails), extracting information from city agencies, project grants and other public sources.  This presentation will provide a brief overview of the key contributions of GIS to this 15-year collaboration of multidisciplinary multi-institutional childhood obesity research. It will then focus on the geospatial challenges encountered and lessons learned.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#climate-and-carbon","title":"Climate and Carbon","text":"<p>11:15 - 12:00 CST (12:15 - 1:00 EST)</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#conference-recordings","title":"Conference Recordings","text":"<p>BTAA GIS Conference 2022 Planning Committee</p> <ul> <li>Karen Majewicz (Chair), Geospatial Product Manager, University of Minnesota, majew030@umn.edu</li> <li>Tara Anthony, GIS Specialist, Penn State University, tll38@psu.edu</li> <li>Caroline Kayko, Map and Geospatial Data Librarian, University of Michigan, ckayko@umich.edu</li> <li>Shirley Li, GIS Analyst, Purdue University, li1050@purdue.edu</li> <li>Laura Kane McElfresh, Cartographic Metadata Librarian, University of Minnesota, mcelf008@umn.edu </li> <li>Theresa Quill, Map and Spatial Data Librarian, Indiana University, theward@indiana.edu</li> <li>Josh Sadvari, Geospatial Information Librarian, Ohio State University, sadvari.1@osu.edu</li> <li>Nicole Scholtz, Librarian for Geospatial and Numeric Data, University of Michigan, nscholtz@umich.edu</li> <li>Amanda Tickner, GIS Specialist, Michigan State University, atickner@msu.edu</li> </ul>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/","title":"2022 Map Gallery","text":""},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#interactive-maps","title":"Interactive Maps","text":""},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#my-math-and-english-story-imme-an-illustrated-guide","title":"My Math and English Story (IMME): An Illustrated Guide","text":"<p>Elizabeth C.

Etienne, Purdue University</p> <p>Agriculture is among the most dangerous occupations in America, ranking in the top-five in 2019 by The National Institute of Safety and Health (NIOSH, 2021). While major causes and types of farm-related injuries have been well-documented, safety mechanisms and advancements in technologies have failed to reduce injury amount and severity. For the purpose of research discussed in this report, agricultural injury cases will primarily be referred to as agricultural or farm-related incidents. In recent years, research has been undertaken to document and classify agricultural incidents within various, online databases. However, to the author\u2019s knowledge, only one such database utilizes a geographic information system (GIS) map to visualize where incidents are located throughout the United States (U.S.) and Canada. However, location accuracy of these incidents is wide ranging. Upon further analysis, multiple locations were linked to the same injury report. While useful for providing a visualization of where an incident occurred, little to no data processing has been done for this database map. Furthermore, no GIS analysis of this data has been undertaken, to the author\u2019s knowledge. The objective of this research was to identify and visualize contextual relationships between farm-related incidents and emergency response time. An initial research hypothesis was that response time to farm-related incidents would increase with increasing distance from emergency medical services (EMS) and cellular tower proximity.  </p>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#static-maps","title":"Static Maps","text":"<p>Tip</p> <p>Click the thumbnails to pan and zoom the images.</p> <p>Map Gallery Coordinator: Caroline Kayko (ckayko@umich.edu), University of Michigan </p>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#relations-between-covid-19-and-used-territory-human-development-and-uneven-development-parameters-in-mesoamerica-and-the-caribbean","title":"Relations between COVID-19 and used territory, human development and uneven development parameters in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean","text":"<ul> <li>Luis F.

As we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, local public health departments, school boards, and city councils make decisions that influence health factors and outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand the relationships between locality and health. However, the average health of a place may not represent all people living in that place. To quantify potential place-based race/ethnicity disparities, we calculated population-weighted between group variance (BGV) with each county\u2019s average age-adjusted mortality rate as the reference value. We then normalized each BGV value and assigned percentile and color groupings. As shown in the map, we did not calculate BGV for counties with missing or suppressed age-adjusted mortality rates for more than two race/ethnicity identity groups. Most counties with missing BGV values are predominantly white and have small population size. This is a sticky problem - lack of available data does not necessarily mean lack of disparity! For counties that have BGV values, race/ethnicity disparities appear visually to be worse in 2020 than in all prior years. This is likely due to differential rates of mortality from COVID-19 across race/ethnicity identities resulting from structural inequities and historical healthcare gaps. We use this map to illustrate the difficulties of assessing place-based health disparities on a national scale and to emphasize the need for greater identity and place-specific health data.  </p>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#mapping-thermal-regimes-for-a-wild-bird-expanding-its-range-south","title":"Mapping thermal regimes for a wild bird expanding its range south","text":"<p>Mary Woodruff, Indiana University</p> <p>Climate change is dramatically altering conditions. 80% of animals are shifting their ranges northward or to higher altitudes in response to rising temperatures, but the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) is expanding its North American breeding range to warmer, southeastern US climates. It remains unclear, however, the degree to which temperatures in this expansion would be considered \u2018hot\u2019 for a tree swallow. To address this, I asked: (1) What areas have experienced frequent \u2018hot days\u2019 in the last decade? (2) How have patterns of \u2018hot days\u2019 changed over time? I defined a \u2018hot day,\u2019 as when a tree swallow chick initiates behavioral and physiological thermoregulation. My previous research has demonstrated that chicks thermoregulate (i.e., pant and upregulate heat shock proteins) when nest temperatures reach 38\u00b0C \u2013 equivalent to 26\u00b0C air temperatures because bird houses are hotter than ambient. Therefore, days with maximum air temperatures above 26\u00b0C were considered \u2018hot.\u2019 To assess temperature patterns over time, I calculated the total number of \u2018hot days\u2019 during tree swallow breeding (April-June) from 2012-2022 using ERA5 data. I present maps showing (1) the percent of \u2018hot days\u2019 and (2) an emerging hot spot analysis of \u2018hot days.\u2019 These data show that birds breeding in North and South Carolina face frequent and consistent \u2018hot days.\u2019 Further, populations may differ in thermal tolerance across the range expansion. Future work will measure markers of thermal tolerance across populations, ultimately informing how birds are responding to climate change and laying the foundation for work exploring the evolution of thermal resilience. </p>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#real-working-patterns-in-hong-kong","title":"Real Working Patterns in Hong Kong","text":"<p>Jusphonia LS Ho, University of Wisconsin-Madison</p> <p>It is a longform infographic map describing the weekly working hours among Hong Kong people.

The work was done using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), which divides land into six-mile square townships and one-mile square sections. It established the township, range and section grid; the pattern upon which land ownership and land use is based. The aim of the survey was to divide the land into lots that could be sold, or otherwise divested, to raise funds for the federal government and to encourage settlement. In general, this work took place near the end of the 18th century and throughout the 19th century. Survey dates for specific plats vary depending on the state/region.</p> <p>The survey work was done by the General Land Office (GLO), an agency of the Treasury Department until 1849 and thereafter a part of the Interior Department.

These tutorials cover a wide range of activities designed to meet the needs of instructors and students in a wide range of disciplines and levels of competency in geospatial data retrieval, use, and analysis.</p> <p>Types of Geospatial Information, by Nicole Kong at Purdue University, introduces students to the most commonly used types of data in GIS. Using a range of visual and diagrammatic examples, it reviews the different data models that GIS professionals typically use to collect and share information, and which are discoverable through geodata portals.</p> <p>Find a Map, by Danny Dotson at Ohio State University, is designed to help students locate a map for a given topic and use it in a document. This tutorial reviews the steps required to locate a relevant map, using the BTAA Geoportal, how to download or copy the scanned map, how to insert the map into a given document, and provides an overview of basic fair use and copyright implications for using these maps.</p> <p>Find Geospatial Data, by Joshua Sadvari at Ohio State University, is intended to help geoportal users frame a search strategy and perform a search for geospatial data. The tutorial is divided into two activities designed to teach students how to access relevant geospatial data using the BTAA Geoportal based on their research or assignment objectives.</p> <p>Evaluate Geospatial Information, by Ryan Mattke at the University of Minnesota, is designed to help students evaluate geospatial data on the BTAA Geoportal for research and coursework. This tutorial reviews how to determine if metadata exist for a resource, how to review this metadata to understand the data\u2019s authority, quality, and relevance, and where to find citation information for resources found with the geoportal.</p> <p>Use GIS Web Services, by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, is meant to give GIS users a basic understanding of GIS web services, how to find them using the BTAA Geoportal, and how to use them in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Pro. The tutorial also contains a link to a walkthrough demonstrating how to use GIS web services to create an interactive web map with Leaflet.</p> <p>Link Tabular Data to Geospatial Data, by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, provides step-by-step instructions for downloading and visualizing spreadsheet data in ArcGIS Online by linking tabular data to geospatial data with a key index variable. More specifically, the tutorial gives an overview of how to locate and download a Wisconsin county boundaries shapefile and a data table of population for each county from the US Census Bureau. The tutorial then explains how to prepare the data, add these files to ArcGIS Online, and join the Census data to the county shapefile using the matching county names column in both files. Finally, the tutorial introduces how to symbolize the joined data using county population.</p> <p>Georeference, by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois, guides ArcMap users through the steps of georeferencing a scanned historic map of Hyde Park, Chicago. Georeferencing allows GIS users to employ scanned maps as thematically appropriate base maps for geospatial data. It is a particularly useful skill for historical work requiring GIS analysis and mapping. This tutorial explains how to select an appropriate projection, how to add and evaluate control points, how to run the rectification process, how to evaluate the results by making the scanned overlay semi-transparent, and how to publish your output as a tiled map service on ArcGIS Online. Publishing a georeferenced map in this manner allows for easy sharing over the web as well as convenient application in user-interactive web mapping.</p> <p>Digitize, by Nicole Kong at Purdue University, introduces how to use ArcGIS Pro to convert data in raster format, such as scanned maps or aerial imagery, into vector data, like points, lines, and polygons. Through the tutorial, students will get a brief overview of common digitization techniques, including preliminary evaluation of the raster data source, creating new feature classes by using different snapping methods and construction tools in ArcGIS, how to modify created features, and how to add attributes to digitized features. The tutorial also includes an exercise worksheet to reinforce the learned techniques.</p> <p>Create Elevation Surface Models Using LiDAR, by Milan Budhathoki at the University of Maryland, introduces LiDAR datasets and point cloud processing in ArcGIS Pro. In this tutorial, students will download a LiDAR point cloud from the BTAA Geoportal of the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. They will learn how to load this data in ArcGIS Pro and view it over a 2D map and obliquely in 3D. Following this, students will learn how to symbolize the points so that vegetation and buildings can be extracted from the dataset. Students will also learn how to filter all ground points to create a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as well as to create a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from all the points.</p> <p>Build a GIS-Free Open-Source Zonal Stats Tool with Python in Jupyter Notebook, by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, teaches students with a basic knowledge of Python scripting how to make a free-standing zonal statistics tool that is not dependent upon desktop GIS software. This tool can be run on both MacOS and Windows and produces an input form to handle user inputs to determine the percent coverage of a given raster class range within a given polygon. For teachers and students who do not have time to download and install Anaconda-Navigator and Jupyter Notebook, there is a convenient step-by-step breakdown of the required code blocks that can be run in a Binder through GESIS Notebooks. This is particularly useful for those who want to gain a quick understanding of what the code does, but who do not have the capacity or desire to use storage space on their current computer. This tutorial is designed to initiate Python scripters to techniques for building their own GUI-driven GIS tools, which they can share with others who need simple user-friendly ways to analyze geospatial data.</p> <p>Story Maps, by Ryan Mattke at the University of Minnesota, introduces the process of creating a story map by using ArcGIS Online\u2019s StoryMaps interface. This tutorial covers many of the features within this tool that are not readily apparent as well as those that are not very intuitive. Some of these include how to add credits and content attribution, changing text formatting, adding buttons and separators, embedding media, and presenting media using immersive options. The tutorial also links learners to helpful resources for creating compelling story maps.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/01_types-of-geospatial-information/","title":"Types of Geospatial Information","text":"<p>Info</p> <p> Purpose: To introduce the most common types of data in GIS.</p> <p> Estimated time to complete: 30-40 minutes</p> <p> Prepared by: Nicole Kong, Associate Professor, GIS Specialist, Purdue University (kongn@purdue.edu). </p> <p> License: Except where otherwise noted, content in this tutorial is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/01_types-of-geospatial-information/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can use several different types of data.

The os module allows the script to interact with the operating system. Tkinter is a GUI package that allows you to build a dialog box / input form for the tool. The osgeo package offers open source libraries, like gdal and ogr, for working with geospatial data. The numpy library allows for mathematical computations, while rasterio and rasterstats allow you easy manipulation and analysis of raster data.</p> <p>Also, you should notice how these lines of code interact with the code below to link the defined inputs to the GUI widgets.

If the classes are higher or lower than the input range, these will be redefined as 0. If the classes match the desired range, they will be redefined as 1. Then, the code creates a new file called \u201craster2\u201d in the same directory as the input raster and sets the projection.</p> <pre><code>    file = gdal.Open(input_value_raster)\n    band = file.GetRasterBand(1)\n\n\n    # reclassification\n    classification_values = [0,low_class_int,high_class_int + 1]\n    classification_output_values = [0,1,0]\n\n    block_sizes = band.GetBlockSize()\n    x_block_size = block_sizes[0]\n    y_block_size = block_sizes[1]\n\n    xsize = band.XSize\n    ysize = band.YSize\n\n    max_value = band.GetMaximum()\n    min_value = band.GetMinimum()\n\n    if max_value == None or min_value == None:\n         stats = band.GetStatistics(0, 1)\n         max_value = stats[1]\n         min_value = stats[0]\n\n    # create new file\n    file2 = driver.Create( ras_dir_path + '/raster2' + file_ext, xsize , ysize , 1, gdal.GDT_Byte)\n\n    # spatial ref system\n    file2.SetGeoTransform(file.GetGeoTransform())\n    file2.SetProjection(file.GetProjection())\n</code></pre> <p>The following block of code assigns the newly defined classes to each pixel in the \u201craster2\u201d file by reading the input pixel values as an array and assigning new values based on a translation of classification breaks from the input \u201cclassification_values\u201d [0, 3, 7] to the output \u201cclassification_output_values\u201d [0, 1, 0]. Thus, any value less than 3 or greater than or equal to 7 is reclassified as 0, while anything greater than or equal to 3 and less than 7 is reclassified as 1.</p> <pre><code>print('Reassigning raster values...please wait...')\nfor i in range(0, ysize, y_block_size):\n     if i + y_block_size &lt; ysize:\n          rows = y_block_size\n     else:\n          rows = ysize - i\n     for j in range(0, xsize, x_block_size):\n          if j + x_block_size &lt; xsize:\n               cols = x_block_size\n          else:\n               cols = xsize - j\n\n          data = band.ReadAsArray(j, i, cols, rows)\n          r = zeros((rows, cols), np.uint8)\n\n          for k in range(len(classification_values) - 1):\n               if classification_values[k] &lt;= max_value and (classification_values[k + 1] &gt; min_value ):\n                    r = r + classification_output_values[k] * logical_and(data &gt;= classification_values[k], data &lt; classification_values[k + 1])\n          if classification_values[k + 1] &lt; max_value:\n               r = r + classification_output_values[k+1] * (data &gt;= classification_values[k + 1])\n\n          file2.GetRasterBand(1).WriteArray(r,j,i)\n\nfile2 = None \n</code></pre> <p>Next, the script identifies the projection of the input shapefile and reprojects the \u201craster2\u201d file to match the projection of the shapefile. The reprojected raster is then saved as \u201craster2_reproject\u201d in the same directory as the input raster.
