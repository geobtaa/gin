With the growing number of GIS datasets and digitized historical maps available, it can be challenging to locate the right resources since they are scattered across various platforms and not always tagged with the necessary metadata for easy discovery. To address this issue, the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project launched in 2015 to connect scholars with geospatial resources.</p> <p>One of the primary outputs of the project is the BTAA Geoportal, a comprehensive index of tens of thousands of geospatial resources from hundreds of sources. The Geoportal enables users to search by map, keyword, and category, providing access to scanned maps, digital GIS data, aerial imagery, and interactive mapping applications. All of the resources available through the Geoportal are free and open, and the scanned maps cover countries around the world. Most of the data in the catalog is sourced from local governments, such as states, counties, and cities.</p> <p>The Geoportal is a useful tool because finding local geospatial data through a simple Google search can be difficult due to the lack of visibility of these datasets. The problem is that users need to know which agency is responsible for creating and distributing the data they are looking for and visit that agency's website to access the datasets. For instance, if you are researching a particular neighborhood in a city and need data on the roads, parks, parcels, and city council ward boundaries, you might need to check different state agencies, the city or the county website. But with the Geoportal, you can easily search by What, Where, and When without worrying about the Who or Why.</p> <p>The BTAA Geoportal helps scholars find and access geospatial resources from various sources, enabling them to focus on their research rather than the time-consuming task of finding the right data.</p>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/","title":"Impact Report 2020","text":""},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#impact-report-may-2020","title":"IMPACT REPORT May 2020","text":"<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D20pCiBhUCl1G6hxml46HigpAMAQvGqG/view </p>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#_1","title":"Impact Report 2020","text":""},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#_2","title":"Impact Report 2020","text":"<pre><code>        Project Impacts: Executive Summary\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#participating-institutions-are-now-part-of-a-spatial-data-infrastructure","title":"Participating institutions are now part of a spatial data infrastructure","text":"<pre><code>Involves 13 BTAA institutions\n\n\nEstimated direct cost avoidance/savings of $29,000 per institution per year\n\n\nEstablished governance for growth and sustainability\n\n\nIdentified strategic initiatives for future development\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#geospatial-resources-are-easier-to-find","title":"Geospatial resources are easier to find","text":"<pre><code>Selected and implemented [GeoBlacklight](https://geoblacklight.org/) \u2012 open source, spatial discovery interface\n\n\nAggregated, enhanced, and normalized metadata records for over 30,000 publicly available resources into a single search portal \u2012 includes geospatial data, as well as scanned maps from library collections\n\n\nIncreased usage \u2012 number of users was up by 25% over the past year\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#big-ten-academic-alliance-geospatial-librarians-and-specialists-are-more-connected","title":"Big Ten Academic Alliance geospatial librarians and specialists are more connected","text":"<pre><code>Established monthly meetings as a large group and in topical committees\n\n\nProvided funding for members to present about the project at conferences\n\n\nCollaborated to publish 5 academic articles, present 8 posters, and deliver at least 17 presentations\n\n\nImproved workflows at local institutions\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#we-are-a-leader-in-the-geospatial-community-beyond-the-btaa","title":"We are a leader in the geospatial community beyond the BTAA","text":"<pre><code>Active leadership in the national GeoBlacklight community, including guiding development in open source academic spatial data infrastructures\n\n\nContributed to the GeoBlacklight codebase\n\n\nPublished workflow documentation widely used by the geospatial community\n\n\nProvided consultation to similar projects at other academic institutions\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<pre><code>We have come a long way since the idea for a sustained collaboration across CIC map libraries germinated a decade ago among informal conversations between librarians and directors. This vision began to take shape in 2012 when three map librarians issued a white paper, _A Collaborative Vision for Spatial Scholarship across the CIC_ (Bidney et al., 2012). This paper identified geospatial data as a long term, interdisciplinary need that would necessitate increasingly complex infrastructures to manage. The authors concluded that these infrastructures would likely be prohibitively expensive for each CIC library to maintain individually, and they proposed collaborative solutions for long term management of geospatial resources.\n\n\nThis paper was a major impetus for the creation of the BTAA Geospatial Data Project, with its goal to provide discoverability, facilitate access, and connect scholars to geospatial data resources. The initial pilot project was to deliver on a proof of concept with outcomes that included: a production-level online interface to geospatial data resources, a foundational geospatial metadata standard that would be interoperable and useful into the future, and a set of workflows for collaboratively creating metadata.\n\n\nThe project has since accomplished several of the recommendations laid out in the original white paper, including creating a collective specialized tool for discovering geospatial resources, combining scanned map collections, and encouraging active communication across the BTAA geospatial community. Along the way, it has also become a leader in the larger geospatial community.\n\n\nThe reasons behind the success of the project and its impact are delivered in this report.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#_3","title":"Impact Report 2020","text":""},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#matrix-of-btaa-geospatial-data-project-impacts","title":"Matrix of BTAA Geospatial Data Project Impacts","text":""},{"location":"impactReport_2022-05/#_4","title":"Impact Report 2020","text":"<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png).

Each institution has a major, but equal, stake in the geoportal and can select local resources, such as their state\u2019s geospatial data or their library-owned scanned maps, for inclusion into the geoportal. The geoportal is also open to the public, providing member institutions and contributing agencies the means to increase discoverability to collections for their wider communities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shared expertise</p> <p>This project has also resulted in bringing together specialised expertise related to spatial data infrastructures, including geospatial metadata, application development, and data curation. Project staff members now have demonstrable expertise in the realms of metadata and application development that can be shared both within and beyond the project.</p> </li> <li> <p>Auxiliary staff capacity</p> <p>The number of staff dedicated to GIS or cartographic cataloguing activities varies between institutions. At times, a participating library may have extended periods of position vacancies or funding decisions that result in a gap in these areas of knowledge.

If each library established their own geoportal, it would cost approximately $60,000 to launch and $40,000 per year to maintain \u2012 an average of $44,000 over five years.

Participating Universities can store their campus research data in an institutional repository and index metadata within the BTAA Geoportal. The geoportal serves as a value-added layer to institutional repositories \u2013 where it becomes the trusted geographic search and discovery solution for spatially-enabled content. The combination of local data repositories and the BTAA Geoportal working together helps researchers facing federal data management and broad public/open access requirements.\" - Wisconsin\n\n\"A grad student was looking for GIS data for Twin Cities parks -- we used the geoportal to search due to the map search option (combined with \"parks\" as a keyword). It turned out that St. Paul parks were part of a Ramsey County administrative boundaries data set, which would have been hard to locate with just text searching.\" - Minnesota\n\n\"...the BTAA platform allows much broader exposure to valuable research data like the historic Wisconsin Land Economic Inventory (Bordner Survey) data (digitized vectors from the 1930s scanned maps)\" - Wisconsin\n\n\"It has definitely caused us to work more on getting our scanned maps up to the geoportal.\" - Michigan\n\n\"Our Early Maps of the Americas Collection was previously only available internally, before being added into the geoportal\" - Chicago\n\n\"A graduate student in The Spatial History of Nineteenth-Century Cities: Tokyo, London, New York course was doing a deep dive into London maps. She was particularly interested in the tourist experience during the Victorian Era. I pulled the paper maps she requested, but then showed her the geoportal.

Range Shifts Predicted with Climate Change in a Common North American Songbird","text":"<p>Susan Reed, Indiana University Bloomington</p> <p>With a net loss of 3 billion North American birds since 1970, and 2.5 billion being native migratory birds, it is critical to investigate population dynamics and threats to species that impact abundance 1 and geographic distribution across space and time. Predicting species range in response to variation in climate is a goal shared among the fields of both conservation and evolutionary ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are visual representations of simulated spatial and temporal patterns of a species in response to predictor variables (PVs), making them useful tools for predicting a species\u2019 range for extrapolated future climate scenarios. As rapid environmental change is experienced, animals must adapt to changes in their environment at a minimum of the same rate, lest they risk extinction. Range shifts and adjustments in movement strategies are mechanism of coping with climate change, and SDMs give insight into how these mechanisms may play out in natural populations\u2014information that may be used to forecast population dynamics and persistence. A better understanding of where, when, and how species distributions are shaped provides valuable information to conservation practitioners, evolutionary ecologists, and policy makers for decision-making regarding habitat and species management. Here, I use ArcGIS Pro2 software to demonstrate SDMs of climate niches for a common migratory North American songbird, the slate-colored dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), utilizing contemporary and extrapolated climate scenarios to model changes in its range as it experiences climate change.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#2-estimating-urban-rooftop-solar-power-production-potential-in-chicago","title":"2.

Deep learning-based tree species identification using UAV RGB images*","text":"<p>Yunmei Huang, Purdue University</p> <p>Information at the species level is necessary for precision forest management and biodiversity conservation. However, it remains a challenging task with traditional remote sensing techniques because of the limit in imaging resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, are getting more attentions for their low-cost and high-resolution advantages. However, most of the studies focusing on UAVs images for tree species identification are based on multispectral, hyperspectral images or combined with LiDAR data. The gap exists in using UAVs RGB data to identify tree species at the stand-level in forests with various species, especially for temperate forests. In this study, we built a  species dataset using high-resolution canopy images (3-5 centimeters)  collected by drones from different seasons. Transfer learning techniques were used to test the performance on specie identification using ResNet18, YOLOv5, and EffcientNetb0, which achieved accuracies above 98% among 4 species including northern red oak, black cherry, and white oak. Testing how flight height affects species classification using RGB images from different flight altitudes is one of the projects we are working on. Tree species identification among more species and individual tree detection from natural forests will be part of our future work.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#5-how-would-ses-and-neighborhood-environment-influence-individuals-physical-inactivity-and-psychological-distress-in-the-city-of-chicago","title":"5.

Previous research has repeatedly found that family socio-economic status is related to individuals\u2019 health through multiple pathways, like nutrition intake, social and emotional functioning, and adoption of health risk behaviors. Meanwhile, community environments, like community crimes, green spaces, and access to public health services, are also important to people\u2019s health. In medical sociology, the interacting effects of social factors on the individual level and resources on the community level on individuals\u2019 health have been explored. However, it usually lacks a view of geography due to the limitation of data or methodology skills. This study aims to apply GIS to the field of medical sociology to better understand the pattern of how health is influenced. The City of Chicago provides resourceful data on health and neighborhood characteristics. I propose to combine the Healthy Chicago Survey on individuals living in poverty and the environmental data regarding green spaces, crimes, race/ethnicity segregation, education, etc. to explore is there is a moderating, say a protective, effect on community/neighborhood level environment on the negative effect of low socioeconomic on individuals\u2019 health outcomes, including physical inactivity and serious psychological distress.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#justice-and-social-geography","title":"Justice and Social Geography","text":"<p> 10:00 - 11:00 CST (11:00 - 12:00 EST)</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#reconstructing-historical-neighborhoods-from-historic-sanborn-maps-using-machine-learning","title":"Reconstructing Historical Neighborhoods from historic Sanborn Maps Using Machine Learning","text":"<p>Harvey Miller, Center for Urban and Regional Analysis / The Ohio State University; Yue Lin, CURA/Ohio State; Ningchuan Xiao, CURA/Ohio State; Gerika Logan, CURA/Ohio State </p> <p>The building of the interstate highway system in US cities in the 20th century split and sometimes destroyed entire neighborhoods, mostly those housing African Americans, immigrants and other minorities.

Although it is widely documented that internet availability is inconsistent across rural areas, pockets of neighborhoods in urban areas also lack access. We used the example of Milwaukee, Wisconsin a historically segregated city to show how Federally sanctioned residential segregation in the 1930\u2019s is still reflected in health inequities in socioeconomic health metrics today. We used ArcGIS Pro to map several community socioeconomic metrics such as children in poverty, homeownership rates, and those who have completed high school, as well as historically redlined neighborhoods, against access to high-speed broadband to show the spatial patterns. We then transformed these maps into several GIFs, shared in an article on the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps website and social media platforms, to help users better overlay the different metrics. We find, unsurprisingly, that census tracts with lower percentages of broadband access are correlated with those in which more children live in poverty, fewer individuals own their homes or graduated high school, and were more likely to be redlined in the past. These findings highlight the existence of digital redlining and point to the need to reduce the inequity in broadband access to avoid further harm to communities experiencing disinvestment. </p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#overcoming-the-challenges-of-developing-a-geospatial-database-for-longitudinal-study-of-urban-childhood-obesity","title":"Overcoming the challenges of developing a geospatial database for longitudinal study of urban childhood obesity","text":"<p>David Tulloch, Rutgers University; Kristen Lloyd, Rutgers University; Michael Yedidia, Rutgers University; Derek Delia, Rutgers University; Robin DeWeese, Arizona State University; Francesco Acciai, Arizona State University; Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, Arizona State University</p> <p>Childhood obesity is a complex problem to which a child's environment contributes significantly. Translating the dynamic urban realities of both the food environment and physical activity (PA) environment into consistently measurable variables is a challenging GIS problem, especially in cities with limited municipal data infrastructure. Using proximity as an indicator of access, we created an unique longitudinal dataset for this project which led to a variety of important findings about childhood obesity and access to parks and corner stores, perceptions about safety impacting walkability, and the value of developing an early habit of walking or biking to school. Since 2008, our research team built a routinely updated database representing the dynamic food environment of Camden, Newark, New Brunswick and Trenton, New Jersey. Updates included mapping corner stores, groceries, fruit and vegetable store, bakeries, butchers, supermarkets, as well as fast-food and full-service restaurants. While general food outlet data is acquired from various sources, to be valid each year\u2019s entry needs to be checked with direct contact and using supplementary information sources (e.g. external locational data). Simultaneously, the team mapped the physical activity environment, including parks and PA facilities (like gyms). The database also includes upgrades to community PA features (like parks, trails), extracting information from city agencies, project grants and other public sources.  This presentation will provide a brief overview of the key contributions of GIS to this 15-year collaboration of multidisciplinary multi-institutional childhood obesity research.

However, location accuracy of these incidents is wide ranging. Upon further analysis, multiple locations were linked to the same injury report. While useful for providing a visualization of where an incident occurred, little to no data processing has been done for this database map. Furthermore, no GIS analysis of this data has been undertaken, to the author\u2019s knowledge.

As we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, local public health departments, school boards, and city councils make decisions that influence health factors and outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand the relationships between locality and health. However, the average health of a place may not represent all people living in that place. To quantify potential place-based race/ethnicity disparities, we calculated population-weighted between group variance (BGV) with each county\u2019s average age-adjusted mortality rate as the reference value. We then normalized each BGV value and assigned percentile and color groupings. As shown in the map, we did not calculate BGV for counties with missing or suppressed age-adjusted mortality rates for more than two race/ethnicity identity groups. Most counties with missing BGV values are predominantly white and have small population size. This is a sticky problem - lack of available data does not necessarily mean lack of disparity! For counties that have BGV values, race/ethnicity disparities appear visually to be worse in 2020 than in all prior years. This is likely due to differential rates of mortality from COVID-19 across race/ethnicity identities resulting from structural inequities and historical healthcare gaps. We use this map to illustrate the difficulties of assessing place-based health disparities on a national scale and to emphasize the need for greater identity and place-specific health data.  </p>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#mapping-thermal-regimes-for-a-wild-bird-expanding-its-range-south","title":"Mapping thermal regimes for a wild bird expanding its range south","text":"<p>Mary Woodruff, Indiana University</p> <p>Climate change is dramatically altering conditions. 80% of animals are shifting their ranges northward or to higher altitudes in response to rising temperatures, but the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) is expanding its North American breeding range to warmer, southeastern US climates. It remains unclear, however, the degree to which temperatures in this expansion would be considered \u2018hot\u2019 for a tree swallow. To address this, I asked: (1) What areas have experienced frequent \u2018hot days\u2019 in the last decade? (2) How have patterns of \u2018hot days\u2019 changed over time? I defined a \u2018hot day,\u2019 as when a tree swallow chick initiates behavioral and physiological thermoregulation. My previous research has demonstrated that chicks thermoregulate (i.e., pant and upregulate heat shock proteins) when nest temperatures reach 38\u00b0C \u2013 equivalent to 26\u00b0C air temperatures because bird houses are hotter than ambient. Therefore, days with maximum air temperatures above 26\u00b0C were considered \u2018hot.\u2019 To assess temperature patterns over time, I calculated the total number of \u2018hot days\u2019 during tree swallow breeding (April-June) from 2012-2022 using ERA5 data.

It established the township, range and section grid; the pattern upon which land ownership and land use is based. The aim of the survey was to divide the land into lots that could be sold, or otherwise divested, to raise funds for the federal government and to encourage settlement. In general, this work took place near the end of the 18th century and throughout the 19th century.

These tutorials cover a wide range of activities designed to meet the needs of instructors and students in a wide range of disciplines and levels of competency in geospatial data retrieval, use, and analysis.</p> <p>Types of Geospatial Information, by Nicole Kong at Purdue University, introduces students to the most commonly used types of data in GIS. Using a range of visual and diagrammatic examples, it reviews the different data models that GIS professionals typically use to collect and share information, and which are discoverable through geodata portals.</p> <p>Find a Map, by Danny Dotson at Ohio State University, is designed to help students locate a map for a given topic and use it in a document. This tutorial reviews the steps required to locate a relevant map, using the BTAA Geoportal, how to download or copy the scanned map, how to insert the map into a given document, and provides an overview of basic fair use and copyright implications for using these maps.</p> <p>Find Geospatial Data, by Joshua Sadvari at Ohio State University, is intended to help geoportal users frame a search strategy and perform a search for geospatial data. The tutorial is divided into two activities designed to teach students how to access relevant geospatial data using the BTAA Geoportal based on their research or assignment objectives.</p> <p>Evaluate Geospatial Information, by Ryan Mattke at the University of Minnesota, is designed to help students evaluate geospatial data on the BTAA Geoportal for research and coursework. This tutorial reviews how to determine if metadata exist for a resource, how to review this metadata to understand the data\u2019s authority, quality, and relevance, and where to find citation information for resources found with the geoportal.</p> <p>Use GIS Web Services, by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, is meant to give GIS users a basic understanding of GIS web services, how to find them using the BTAA Geoportal, and how to use them in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Pro. The tutorial also contains a link to a walkthrough demonstrating how to use GIS web services to create an interactive web map with Leaflet.</p> <p>Link Tabular Data to Geospatial Data, by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, provides step-by-step instructions for downloading and visualizing spreadsheet data in ArcGIS Online by linking tabular data to geospatial data with a key index variable. More specifically, the tutorial gives an overview of how to locate and download a Wisconsin county boundaries shapefile and a data table of population for each county from the US Census Bureau. The tutorial then explains how to prepare the data, add these files to ArcGIS Online, and join the Census data to the county shapefile using the matching county names column in both files. Finally, the tutorial introduces how to symbolize the joined data using county population.</p> <p>Georeference, by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois, guides ArcMap users through the steps of georeferencing a scanned historic map of Hyde Park, Chicago. Georeferencing allows GIS users to employ scanned maps as thematically appropriate base maps for geospatial data. It is a particularly useful skill for historical work requiring GIS analysis and mapping. This tutorial explains how to select an appropriate projection, how to add and evaluate control points, how to run the rectification process, how to evaluate the results by making the scanned overlay semi-transparent, and how to publish your output as a tiled map service on ArcGIS Online. Publishing a georeferenced map in this manner allows for easy sharing over the web as well as convenient application in user-interactive web mapping.</p> <p>Digitize, by Nicole Kong at Purdue University, introduces how to use ArcGIS Pro to convert data in raster format, such as scanned maps or aerial imagery, into vector data, like points, lines, and polygons. Through the tutorial, students will get a brief overview of common digitization techniques, including preliminary evaluation of the raster data source, creating new feature classes by using different snapping methods and construction tools in ArcGIS, how to modify created features, and how to add attributes to digitized features. The tutorial also includes an exercise worksheet to reinforce the learned techniques.</p> <p>Create Elevation Surface Models Using LiDAR, by Milan Budhathoki at the University of Maryland, introduces LiDAR datasets and point cloud processing in ArcGIS Pro. In this tutorial, students will download a LiDAR point cloud from the BTAA Geoportal of the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. They will learn how to load this data in ArcGIS Pro and view it over a 2D map and obliquely in 3D. Following this, students will learn how to symbolize the points so that vegetation and buildings can be extracted from the dataset. Students will also learn how to filter all ground points to create a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as well as to create a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from all the points.</p> <p>Build a GIS-Free Open-Source Zonal Stats Tool with Python in Jupyter Notebook, by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, teaches students with a basic knowledge of Python scripting how to make a free-standing zonal statistics tool that is not dependent upon desktop GIS software. This tool can be run on both MacOS and Windows and produces an input form to handle user inputs to determine the percent coverage of a given raster class range within a given polygon. For teachers and students who do not have time to download and install Anaconda-Navigator and Jupyter Notebook, there is a convenient step-by-step breakdown of the required code blocks that can be run in a Binder through GESIS Notebooks. This is particularly useful for those who want to gain a quick understanding of what the code does, but who do not have the capacity or desire to use storage space on their current computer. This tutorial is designed to initiate Python scripters to techniques for building their own GUI-driven GIS tools, which they can share with others who need simple user-friendly ways to analyze geospatial data.</p> <p>Story Maps, by Ryan Mattke at the University of Minnesota, introduces the process of creating a story map by using ArcGIS Online\u2019s StoryMaps interface. This tutorial covers many of the features within this tool that are not readily apparent as well as those that are not very intuitive. Some of these include how to add credits and content attribution, changing text formatting, adding buttons and separators, embedding media, and presenting media using immersive options. The tutorial also links learners to helpful resources for creating compelling story maps.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/01_types-of-geospatial-information/","title":"Types of Geospatial Information","text":"<p>Info</p> <p> Purpose: To introduce the most common types of data in GIS.</p> <p> Estimated time to complete: 30-40 minutes</p> <p> Prepared by: Nicole Kong, Associate Professor, GIS Specialist, Purdue University (kongn@purdue.edu). </p> <p> License: Except where otherwise noted, content in this tutorial is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/01_types-of-geospatial-information/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can use several different types of data.
