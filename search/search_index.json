JPEG/TIFFs: Scanned  historical maps from our library collections are often available for download as either JPEGs or TIFFs. These maps can be viewed as images in your favorite image browser, but they do not have geographic location embedded within the file. Web Services: These data are hosted online by a university, government agency, or another organization. You can use the URL to open the data layer in an online mapping program without having to download it first.Shapefiles: The data will download as a zipped folder containing 3-7 files.

The plat  shows township sections, roads, railroads, boundaries of towns and urban areas, and bodies of water. Local schools, churches and cemeteries are also noted on each map.

This text, published in 1969, put forth ideas about taking the ecology of a region into account when planning homes, neighborhoods, and cities. McHarg\u2019s work was particularly influential in the field of GIS for his proposed methods of using polygon overlays for analysis. McHarg was also part of an architectural firm, Wallace, McHarg, Roberts, and Todd, that was frequently contracted to work with metropolitan areas to assist with urban planning. This firm  worked with the Metropolitan Council of the Twin Cities in Minnesota during the late 1960s. Their work resulted in a report, An Ecological Study of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, that was accompanied by dozens of custom maps detailing the climate, geology, hydrology, biota, and built environment of the region. The original copies of these maps are held at the University of Minnesota\u2019s John R. Borchert Map Library. They measure about 6\u2019x6\u2019 and are a mix of base maps and mylar overlays. These maps were scanned in 2018 at high resolution for a university project to digitize them into geodatabases using ArcGIS. The scans were recently added to the digital repository at the University of Minnesota and can be found in the BTAA Geoportal here.  Researchers at the UMN Institute on the Environment recently received a grant to use this data to create an interactive application to explore the maps and potentially reveal how much of the firm's recommendations came to fruition. A few examples: </p> <p></p> <p>--- Annual Precipitation: Shows variations in precipitation across the Twin Cities in 1965 </p> <p></p> <p>--- Existing, Potential and Proposed Large Scale Open Space Colored pencil overlay indicates parks and urban areas.

Scholars experience unprecedented findability and access to datasets which in turn gives rise to new questions and research topics. In short, knowledge is advanced more broadly, more deeply and in a more timely manner. For example, every municipality, county, and state government is charged with governing some aspect of the public drinking water supply. Every unit of government generates data of one kind or another documenting aspects of water management within its  purview. Scholars studying topics such as aquifers, agriculture, contaminants such as e. Coli, or disaster mitigation draw on these public datasets to advance our collective knowledge. Each dataset is usually generated and maintained in isolation of other local and regional efforts.

Violent clashes broke out across northern India, and, although historians disagree on casualty numbers, at least hundreds of thousands of people were killed. This series of uprisings, known as the Indian Rebellion of 1957, prompted the British government to dissolve the Company and to assert their own direct control over India. Within the next few years, cartographers provided  the government with many new or updated maps illustrating British encampments, transportation routes, and the locations and dates of the major Rebellion conflicts.

This popup also displays how recently the data were updated. By clicking an information button in the top-right corner, users can find more information about the map and the data included. In the top-right corner, there is also a layer control, so that you can toggle between cases and deaths by county. Users can also use the zoom control to display the map at their preferred scale.

I\u2019m often asked \u201cjust what is it that you do?\u201d  I\u2019ll do my best to explain that. </p> <p>An MPO, or Metropolitan Planning Organization, is a federally designated body responsible for regional transportation planning for an urban area. There are about 15 MPOs in Wisconsin and are generally housed within another agency such as a Regional Planning Commission or a County department. In this case the MPO for the Madison urban area, called the Madison Area Transportation Planning Board, is housed within City of Madison of Planning.  So, I am actually City of Madison staff, working for a regional transportation planning organization that provides services to the Madison urban area that also includes Cities and Villages such as the City of Verona and Village of DeForest. Our MPO also has a policy board made up of elected officials from Madison, Dane County, Towns, WisDOT, and smaller villages and cities that our staff report to.</p> <p>To make things even more confusing we are going through a rebranding process that will change our name from Madison Area Transportation Planning Board to Greater Madison MPO.  This comes with a new mission and vision that focuses on a sustainable transportation system connecting people to opportunities.  This is achieved through a series of plans we produce. Our main focus is a Long Range 30-year Transportation Plan that goes through a major overhaul every ten years.  That plan is also composed of several other components that are updated every five years or annually such as a Bicycle Plan, Transit Development Plan, and Transportation Improvement Plan. We also coordinate the areas Rideshare Program.</p> <p>To finish your question, as far as producing GIS data, we are a unique organization within the City of Madison government, in that or world does not end at the City of Madison boundary. For the most part, we require GIS data coverage for all of Dane County, including all the cities and villages.  So, we maintain several data sets that cross municipal boundaries such as bike and pedestrian facilities, transit data, employment, and households.  We also use data from DCLIO such as their road centerlines that we add additional information to.  We are a regional agency that requires municipal level detailed data for all of Dane County. </p> <p>And oh, yes. I have been working for the MPO thirty years now \u2013twenty years housed in the City of Madison \u2013 10 years prior that when housed in the Dane County RPC. I started out as draftsmen making maps with pen and ink at the RPC in 1990.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2020/07/30/2020-07-dan-seidensticker/#can-you-describe-what-gis-data-and-maps-you-create-what-is-your-most-popular-dataproduct","title":"Can you describe what GIS data and maps you create?

Most of it applies to transportation planning in one way or the other.</p> <p>When it comes to our GIS data, I guess you could say it falls in one of two categories: Created entirely in house, or data from a different source that is processed into GIS files.  Some examples of data created in house include on and off-street bicycle facilities, sidewalks and curb cuts, planned land use, bus routes and stops.  A good portion of our in house data is also derived from a various analyses like accessibility indexes, stress levels for biking and walking, and socio-economic forecasts. We also collect a vast amount of data from other sources such  FHWA, Census Bureau, WisDOT, WiDNR, Dane County, Metro Transit, DPI, UW, and private data vendors.  From those sources we get demographic data, street centerlines and addressing, schools and enrollment, crash data, business locations, traffic volumes, and pavement ratings, to name a few.</p> <p>As with our GIS data most of the maps we produce are transportation related.  By far our most popular map, and Web app, is the Dane County Bicycle Map. We give out twenty to thirty-thousand hardcopies a year. One of our more popular Web apps is also biking related and finds the best route based on the comfort level of the rider.  And, yes, a Story Map of course. It highlights popular bike paths in the area.  Most of our maps are geared more toward elected officials, planning staff, and researchers than the general public.  Maps such as transit service areas and ridership, traffic volumes, future transportation projects, employment and household forecasts, and environmental justice areas to name a few.

I used to have a good idea who our data consumers where, but now with most of our maps and data being online, I get far fewer emails and phone calls looking for GIS data and maps.  Don\u2019t get me wrong though, that is a good thing.  Frees up time for more data analysis and creation. \u263a I can say for sure that students are a frequent customer. Students from all over the world actually; especially those studying transportation.  Local and State of Wisconsin government agencies are by far our biggest customer who use the data for a variety of tasks such as finding bus stops to clear snow from, traffic forecasts and bike plans for neighborhood planning, and mapping bike route detours during constriction.  As of late, our data is being used extensively by agencies working on the proposed BRT or Bus Rapid Transit system.</p> <p>On occasion I\u2019ll see a map or comment on a blog about our data too. Last week I saw a map where a local bike advocate created a map on where to find bicycle repair stations. Those repair station locations came from our open data portal. Our GIS data falls under the City\u2019s Open Data policy where all data is free of charge with no data sharing agreement.  So I don\u2019t have something in place to get a better idea who is using our data for what.

It certainly does not have all our datasets though.  Far too many. A large portion of our data is from a one-time analysis and it doesn\u2019t make sense to go through the effort to make it available on the portal.  </p> <p>The portal is only configured to download shape files.  So, if someone wants a geodatabase, or something not available off the portal, I manually place it on our FTP site for retrieval.  There is also a data dictionary posted on our Website that lists many of the datasets we use.</p> <p>Our transition to the Open Data Portal was done along with several other City agencies. Prior to the portal, all agencies were doing GIS distribution on their own.  The City of Madison\u2019s IT department for a long time steered clear of GIS.  Eventually it became evident it was necessary to centralize some GIS operations across the City to save money and get rid of some redundancy, so IT hired their own GIS staff.  IT then moved to an Enterprise GIS  with a license server and SDE.  Shortly afterwards ArcGIS Online and the Open Data Portal were set up.  The IT department then reached out to individual agencies, including ours, to distribute data through the portal. As far as getting the data published in the portal\u2026each City of Madison agency has their own SDE instances they are responsible for keeping current. ArcGIS Online applications and the portal are connected to secure connections of those SDE instances.  Each agency simply maintains a single MXD with all the datasets they want available on the portal and IT publishes that MXD to make the data available publicly. We also index your data for discovery in GeoData@Wisconsin and the Big Ten Geoportal. At the Map Library, we archive some MPO layers that we know are useful to students. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2020/07/30/2020-07-dan-seidensticker/#do-you-find-that-our-added-exposurediscovery-to-your-data-is-helpful-are-you-also-archiving-snapshots-of-your-own-data-each-year","title":"Do you find that our added exposure/discovery to your data is helpful?

We spent a significant amount of time collecting sidewalk centerlines and curb cuts for all of Dane County.   We are incorporating those into our network of street centerlines and transit routes.   With that network we will be able to look at accessibility analysis taking into account ADA compliancy. For example, we will be able to identify areas where it is difficult for someone with a wheelchair to access the transit system.</p> <p>Another interesting realm of GIS data we are using more frequently is big data from GPS and LBS enabled devices, in other words your smart phone.  We have subscription based access to this data now. This data opens all sorts of new data productions and analysis options.  In transportation planning, we are always studying where people are going, from where, and why.  Traditionally that was accomplished through mailed household surveys or on-board bus surveys.  These types of survey still provide valuable information, but now we can supplement those results by simply logging into a dashboard.  Not only can we see the traffic volume count on any road segment, we can break it down by time and day, and see if the trips are by car, bike, bus, or on foot.  Also see where trips originated and ended.  There is of course no personal information tied to this data and it\u2019s reported at a geographic level that does not make it possible to single out an address. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2020/07/30/2020-07-dan-seidensticker/#have-current-events-altered-our-data-production-plans","title":"Have current events altered our data production plans?","text":"<p>Oh yes, it has.  When I hear current events I\u2019m thinking both the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests.   As for the latter, our plans always had an environmental justice component.  We look at minority concentrations, poverty levels, and auto-less households in our analyses -- but we\u2019ve also come to the realization we can do better. We have just started working on remapping the environmental justice areas and looking how to make it more visible in our plans.</p> <p>As for the pandemic, it hasn\u2019t slowed data production. If anything there will be more, but the data content and type of analysis will certainly be altered. One of our main functions is traffic forecasting which comes from employment and household forecasts.  Will the pandemic still have an impact on the work force 15 years from now? How many jobs will switch to working from home permanently?  Are employment centers going shrink or move?  How is traffic volume and transit ridership going to be impacted?  The pandemic will certainly impact our forecast models.  What we\u2019ve known in the past, no longer applies today.  We\u2019ve just begun to look at this. </p> <p>Thanks for giving me the opportunity to talk, Jaime.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2020/08/31/2020-08-featured-collection-university-of/","title":"Featured Collection: University of Chicago Library GIS Data Hub","text":"<p>By Cecilia Smith University of Chicago Library GIS Data Hub</p>","tags":["featured collections","Chicago","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2020/08/31/2020-08-featured-collection-university-of/#what-is-the-item-the-university-of-chicagos-gis-data-hub-is-a-portal-to-a-curated-set-of-historical-chicagoland-data-there-are-currently-33-vector-layers-covering-different-themes-the-data-was-produced-by-several-sources-including-uchicago-researchers-and-library-map-collection-staff-what-btaa-library-submitted-the-item-university-of-chicago-interesting-tidbits","title":"What is the item?

This dataset is managed by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources on the Iowa Geodata website. From this dataset, you can download the National Flood Hazard Layer, which includes the Iowa portion of the regulatory dataset produced by FEMA for their Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). It is particularly useful to community officials and members of the public who wish to know which parts of  their communities are within areas FEMA defines as having a 1-percent-annual-chance for a flood event, a 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, or minimal flood risk. In this post, I will take a look at one presentation of the data in an interactive online map. I live in Iowa City, in Johnson County. By downloading the data as a geodatabase, I can open it in QGIS, extract the features within Johnson County, and export a GeoJSON file for use in an online map. The resulting file is quite large, so potential users may wish to look into a few ways to handle large file sizes by using different data formats or employ preferred methods of reducing the size of the exported GeoJSON file. Incorporating, styling, and formatting the data for online use with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, we can see how this data can be presented in a more user-friendly format. This can then be shared with any number of stakeholders in flood-related planning or mitigation efforts. Here, the map has been furnished with a legend describing the relevant flood risk classes in Johnson County, popup content further clarifying these classes when the user clicks on a flood zone, and an information button in the top-right corner explaining the map and data sources. Users can zoom out to see Johnson County in its entirety or zoom in for a closer look at their neighborhood or property.

SEMCOG membership is open to all seven counties in the region (Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne), cities (including the City of Detroit), villages, townships, intermediate school districts, and community colleges. Membership currently totals 175 entities. #### What is your role at SEMCOG? My position as Manager of Geospatial Technology at SEMCOG, allows me to focus much of my time on bringing people together to work collaboratively. We meet with counties, communities, private firms, academia, and non-profit agencies to discuss changes in the industry, best practices, and the challenges of keeping up with the ever-changing GIS technology. We share data and work together to create data that we all need. In 2010, we created the first region-wide building footprint layer and provided that data to counties and local governments. We maintain this data for most of the region, but in some cases we work in partnership with local governments who update the data and provide it back to SEMCOG. The building footprint data layer for the City of Detroit is our most popular data layer within our Open Data Portal. More recently, we contracted to create region-wide sidewalk data and made it available through our Open Data Portal. This is the newest data layer in our Open Data Portal. #### What is unique about your offerings that others would be interested to know? The SEMCOG region is just under 5,000 square miles, with a population of 4.7 million. The population is about half of the entire State of Michigan. It includes seven counties and, 234 cities, villages, and townships., Communities range from urban, to suburban, to rural. SEMCOG has been creating geospatial data layers for almost 30 years. SEMCOG creates and maintains a variety of geospatial datasets, most of which can be previewed, mapped, and downloaded through SEMCOG\u2019s Open Data Portal. Much of the data we create is needed for regional planning projects, such as transportation planning, environmental work, regional forecasting, and infrastructure work. We always have our member communities in mind when we create data. Knowing how communities use the data is important, as we want the data to be useful to others as well.

Although it is important to allow others to access and download our data, I feel it is just as important to visualize the data to tell the story of our region. We have very talented staff at SEMCOG who build these maps in a variety of mapping platforms. Within the Map Gallery, the newest maps are always at the top, under the \u2018featured\u2019 section. A few of the most recent maps are the interactive 3D Building Footprint map, the Census 2020 Self-Response Rate map, and the Lake St. Clair Habitat Restoration map. Our most popular map contains Traffic Volume data for the region. This data is very useful for transportation planning and economic development. </p> <p></p> <p>SEMCOG staff enjoy a unique spot in Detroit Thank you for the opportunity to talk about the great work that SEMCOG does.

What is the mission of your agency? The DNR has three primary missions: 1) to  conserve and manage natural resources; 2) to provide outdoor recreation opportunities; and 3) to support commercial uses of natural resources. These missions are sometimes in conflict, but all relate to promoting a high quality of sustainable life &amp; good management of our environment\u2026the better the data you have, the better you can conserve and manage resources. #### 2. How is your geospatial data distributed? Much of the data that the DNR produces is available on the Minnesota Geospatial Commons. This website provides a way for government agencies in Minnesota to share data internally with one another and externally with the public. We are the largest contributor to the Commons, which also has data from counties, the University of Minnesota, state agencies and other local governments. In addition to datasets, the DNR publishes geoPDF maps of parks, trails, and ATV paths to Avenza for use in recreation.

Another popular dataset has been wildfire tracking (Wildfires Tracked by Minnesota DNR). Counties use this for tracking costs of damage and claims. In the last year, there has been a lot of interest in data connected to the Minnesota Hydrogeology Atlas, which contains information like water-table elevation and depth to the water table. Another popular resource published in the past year has been 2019 NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) satellite imagery. We sometimes download and republish data like this - information that was created by other agencies. We have to be careful because we don\u2019t want to duplicate or cause confusion about data that will eventually be available somewhere else.

Do you have any datasets / projects that are in the works you would like to share? We are working on extending our Minnesota Climate Trends application to include projections of future climate. Using a simple map interface, you can currently choose delineations of interest such as counties, watersheds, municipalities -- however you want to slice it. You can choose four counties, you can do statewide... Within these areas of interest you can see long-term climate trends from 1895 to the present day such as precipitation and temperatures. The new projections are being developed in partnership with the State Climatologist who works at University of Minnesota (in a hybrid arrangement). They are working together with DNR to produce climate predictions. The predictions look at mid-century (2040-2050) and late century (2080-2090) under two scenarios: a best case scenario and then a worst case scenario --like if we just gave up. It will be less of a month-to-month prediction of changes and more focused on broad trends. The mid-century data is already pretty scary -- for instance it predicts that there could be double digit temperature increases in winter. Hopefully the application will be available in the next few months or by the end of the year. #### 6. Anything else you want folks to know? The last few months have required a large transition to work-from-home and mobile work. Our staff provide a mix of applications and support - so we do a lot of work helping others access information and technology. Data has been loading slower for folks working-from-home. We have had to be creative trying to mitigate that and walking people through workarounds. GIS is central to the DNR\u2019s mission! Thank you, Mr. Thomas for the great interview!

What is the mission of your agency? Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA) is Pennsylvania's official public access open geospatial data portal. PASDA was developed in 1995 by the Pennsylvania State University and has served as the geospatial data portal for Pennsylvania for over twenty five years. PASDA is a cooperative project of the Governor's Office of Administration, Office for Information Technology, and Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment of the Pennsylvania State University. Funding and support is provided by the Pennsylvania Office for Information Technology. Penn State contributions include system administration support and infrastructure from the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences, and the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. PASDA was developed as a service to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The purpose of PASDA is to serve as the Commonwealth's comprehensive and coordinated open geospatial data portal that provides free public access to geospatial data and information by, for, and about the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. PASDA is Pennsylvania's node on data.gov and is integrated with the National States Geographic Information Council GIS Inventory. One of the primary purposes of PASDA is to facilitate data sharing in a streamlined environment, making the process fast and easy for data sharing stakeholders. Any state agency, local government, non governmental agency, or academic institution can share its geospatial data through PASDA at no charge. PASDA is based on a long term vision that incorporates free access to data, outreach, and service to our users and data providers in order to maximize the benefits to the citizens of the Commonwealth. The keystones in the success of the program are:","text":"<ul> <li>Collaboration--PASDA demonstrates that collaboration among the geospatial community benefits everyone in the Commonwealth.

The Parcel Initiative is a multi-faceted, multi-year collaborative effort of the Department of Administration, State Cartographer's Office, and local governments. The predecessor to the Statewide Parcel Initiative was the LinkWISCONSIN Address Point and Parcel Mapping  Project, which ran from July 2013 through September 2014. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW) launched a statewide broadband initiative with goals to map broadband service within the state, develop a vision for broadband in Wisconsin, and work to extend broadband access to underserved areas. The initiative included the creation of an interactive map to track broadband availability, speed, and providers. In an effort to add capabilities and value to broadband mapping, the PSCW approved the collaboration between the State Cartographer's Office (SCO) and the Wisconsin Land Information Program (WLIP) at the Department of Administration (DOA) to develop statewide address point and parcel layers based on county data. The final address point layer totaled 2.7 million address points and the parcel layer totaled 3.7 million parcels.

In each interview, providers tell us about their missions and data resources. We hope this will be a great way for readers to learn more about local GIS developments and new initiatives. </p> <p></p> <p>Name: Aaron Schill Title: Director of Data &amp; Mapping Division/Department: Data &amp; Mapping, Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) Website: www.morpc.org/data </p> <p></p> <p>1) Can you describe MORPC's mission and talk a little bit  about how the geospatial data you create support that mission? MORPC is Central Ohio\u2019s regional council for nearly 75 members comprised of counties, cities, villages, townships, and regional organizations in the 15-county region. We take pride in bringing communities of all sizes and interests together to collaborate on best practices and plan for the future of our growing region. We do this through a variety of programs, services, projects and initiatives \u2013 and nearly all of them require some type of geospatial data. Relevant, timely, and reliable data provides the foundation for nearly all of our work at MORPC. Whether evaluating transportation projects for funding, tracking regional sustainability initiatives, or developing new strategies to meet affordable housing needs, our member communities and partners look to MORPC for access to data and expert, objective analyses. Public data accessibility is an important emphasis of our work as well. We advocate for making data openly available and accessible, and we strive to do so whenever possible with the data we create and maintain. To make our work more accessible we maintain an open data site, which was upgraded to Esri\u2019s latest HUB platform last year. The majority of the data we create or maintain is available for download in machine-readable format and is highlighted in web maps, to meet the needs of various users. If you\u2019re in the MOOD to check out our data resources, visit our Mid-Ohio Open Data site at www.morpc.org/data. 2) How does MORPC compare with other agencies in Franklin County, surrounding counties, or statewide that produce geospatial data? Are there other agencies in Central Ohio that you often collaborate with on projects, and if so, what do those collaborations usually look like? Regionalism and collaboration are core tenets to everything we do at MORPC, and our data work is no different. On a daily basis, we work with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), the Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program (OGRIP), the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), county auditors and engineers, numerous municipalities and townships, and a host of other partners across Central Ohio. These days, many have their data available for download, which makes compiling local data into regional datasets or breaking state or national level data down to digestible chunks much easier than it was in the past. Our regional scope does give us a slightly different perspective than most of the organizations we work with. Rather than creating most of our own data, or accessing existing resources that already conform to our area of interest, we frequently find ourselves gathering data from diverse sources, which was often generated for a different purpose, and compiling it to meet our needs. For example, we gather and standardize building permit data from over 30 permitting agencies in the region to inform our population estimates and projections. It is a labor of love, as anyone who deals with data knows, it comes in all shapes, sizes and formats. However, it\u2019s that comfort working with messy and disparate data that allows us to be nimble and creative in working with so many partners and on so many diverse topics that are important to our community. Collaboration also comes in the form of the quarterly Central Ohio GIS User Group (COGUG) and Regional Information &amp; Data Group (RIDG) meetings we host at MORPC. All GIS professionals and folks who work with data about Central Ohio are invited to participate, and each meeting averages about 45 attendees. It is a great way to network, share information, and help each other with data and technology issues. Our Greater Franklin County Location Based Response System (LBRS) project, which began 15 years ago, is perhaps the best example of geospatial data collaboration, and has been elevated by Esri as a best practice. The project started as a way to cooperatively maintain an authoritative road centerline and address point file, to reduce redundancy. Eleven addressing authorities in Franklin County have a two-way replica of a versioned map/geodata service. They each edit it remotely and sync changes back to their version of the data at MORPC. The versions are then all reconciled with the parent geodatabase housed at MORPC. This allows the cities to focus on their own data, but benefit from current data surrounding them with the push of a button or an automated script. Over the years this methodology has expanded to include bikeways and sidewalk centerlines. 3) Can you describe what geospatial data, maps, or apps you create? What is your most popular dataset or product? As our GIS Manager, Cheri Mansperger, likes to remind us, \u201cAll data is spatial data!\u201d Given the place-based nature of our work, she\u2019s absolutely right. MORPC has core transportation and planning work that is very data hungry, so not surprisingly, almost all of the data we create or compile ties back to those purposes. Our long-range Metropolitan Transportation Plan (MTP), which we complete every four years is our hungriest. Any transportation project in our planning area, that will utilize federal funding, is included in the MTP and must be evaluated. Much of the data on MOOD is created because it is an input for, or an output of, the MTP. We track and map proposed development, building permits, bikeways, sidewalks, points of interest, group quarters, existing and proposed land uses and various environmental data. One output of the MTP, via our regional land use model, is sub-county population and employment forecast data for the region for the next several decades. Beyond just the data, several web apps were also created throughout the MTP process, including a map that allowed the public to draw proposed projects and comment on other proposed projects, as well as a land use review map that was shared with local governments to allow them to provide feedback on our data and forecasts. These apps are very useful both as tools to share data and as vehicles for public and stakeholder engagement. Now that the 2020-2050 MTP is finalized, the web app\u2019s final forecast data, with projections out to 2050, are hosted on MOOD. The Columbus Metro Bike User Map is another web app we host and is probably the most popular. We combine mapping of existing bikeways in the region with roads that are coded based on their \u201clevel of bike friendliness.\u201d </p> <p></p> <p>MTP 2020-2050 Population and Employment Forecasts </p> <p></p> <p>Columbus Metro Bike Map </p> <p></p> <p>Central Ohio COVID-19 Resource Hub More recently, in response to COVID-19, we created a HUB site dedicated to helping our members navigate the pandemic. It continues to evolve over time, based on needs and requests and data availability. The Esri HUB template and Living Atlas, as well as several automated data feeds our team created, make it easy to maintain and quickly share data. OGRIP also did a great job at making statewide data available. For our purposes we like to zoom in on our region, so it is relatable and easier for our members to consume. 4) Do you know of examples of how your data are being used in an educational context? If so, can you tell us more about that? If not, what would you say to encourage university instructors or students who you think could benefit from using your data in class projects? One of the interesting things about having data easily available via an open data site is that you don\u2019t know who is downloading it or what they are using it for. If the data is well formatted and has metadata, they don\u2019t even need to ask you questions about it. In the past we used to get more than our share of students calling or emailing for the bikeway, population and employment forecasts, and various other datasets \u2013 a sudden influx of requests for the same datasets was a pretty good indicator that a professor had assigned a new project. By making our data more accessible to those who are self-sufficient, our team is better able to assist those who need more hands-on support or who have more complex data needs. While many professors, researchers, and students access our data without ever interacting with a MORPC staff person, we do work closely with academic partners, particularly at Ohio State. We have a strong and growing relationship with the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis (CURA), which includes development of our recently completed Regional Sustainability Dashboard. Depending on the work, we partner with faculty and staff from across Ohio State, ranging from the Center for Automotive Research; to Planning, Architecture, and Real Estate; to the Sustainability Institute; to the Knowlton School\u2019s City and Regional Planning section, just to name a few. I would encourage students and faculty alike to check out our open data resources or to connect with our team about opportunities to work together. 5) Can you talk about any interesting projects MORPC is currently working on or that are planned for the near future? Are there new initiatives or current events that have altered your data production in any way, or new datasets you intend to distribute that might find their way into the BTAA Geoportal? We always have something interesting in the works, but a few recent and upcoming initiatives stand out. We recently completed a Regional Housing Strategy to address issues of housing supply and affordability across Central Ohio. Among the substantial data collection and analyses, we developed two new methods and datasets that are particularly unique. One was a housing submarket analysis, which divided all Census tracts in the region into 12 distinct submarket typologies based on their physical and market characteristics. The other was a displacement risk analysis, which identifies areas of the region that are experiencing or at risk of residential displacement due to varying degrees of gentrification. Both of these are first-of-their-kind analyses for Central Ohio and I\u2019m looking forward to the opportunities they create to inform better housing policies and strategies. </p> <p></p> <p>Buffer analysis for Central Ohio Greenways trail network in Franklin County, Ohio  Currently we are working on a project to prioritize all of the proposed projects for the Central Ohio Greenways (COG) trail network in Franklin County. Through analysis of our bikeway and road networks, we developed walksheds and bikesheds for the entire existing and proposed COG network. We are now developing a set of indices that can be used to evaluate the relative impact of building any given segment of proposed trail. The indices will measure a diverse range of factors including connectivity, social equity, environment, and the economy. The geospatial project I am most excited about is one that will get underway before the end of this year. We will be working with Esri and their ArcGIS Urban platform to create a 3D base map and scenario planning tool for Central Ohio. Franklin County will be the pilot area, with plans to expand out to surrounding counties in the future. Using the latest high-resolution LiDAR data and building footprints, we will work with Esri staff to build the base 3D model and incorporate existing land use and zoning data. ArcGIS Urban allows for various planning and development scenarios to be \u201cbuilt\u201d on the base model, and provides robust data analysis capabilities. This tool will help us to visualize and better understand the impacts of potential new developments across the region. Several partners have come together to help fund the project and are committed to using it in planning efforts going forward; the partners include MORPC, City of Columbus, City of Dublin, City of Westerville, COTA, and Ohio State. Once it is launched, anyone will be able to access and view the model, and any local government with its own ArcGIS Urban seats will be able to contribute their own future plans and development back to the regional model. </p> <p></p> <p>Data &amp; Mapping staff stop for a selfie after a retreat, where we volunteered at a community garden and then went for a hike.

His book \u201cThe Physical Geography of the Sea and its Meteorology\u201d is considered the first modern textbook on the topic.","text":"<p>A 1923 painting of Matthew Fontaine Maury shows the officer standing behind a globe. credit: Ella Sophonisba Hergesheimer, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</p>","tags":["maps","Featured items","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2021/01/25/2021-01-featured-item-chart-showing-favorite/#interesting-tidbit-the-maps-legend-is-text-only-it-simply-says-red-and-blue-beside-the-corresponding-whale-species-where-can-i-find-out-more","title":"Interesting tidbit The map\u2019s legend is text-only, it simply says \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d beside the corresponding whale species. ### Where can I find out more?","text":"<ul> <li>Encyclopaedia Britannica</li> <li>National Parks Service Caroline Kayko is the Map &amp; Geospatial Data Librarian at the University of Michigan.This was originally posted on blogger here.</li> </ul>","tags":["maps","Featured items","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2021/02/15/2021-02-aerial-imagery-cook-county-illinois-2003/","title":"Aerial Imagery: Cook County, Illinois, 2003","text":"<p>By Cecilia Smith</p>","tags":["Illinois","aerial photography","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2021/02/15/2021-02-aerial-imagery-cook-county-illinois-2003/#featured-item-aerial-imagery-cook-county-illinois-2003-what-is-the-item-this-is-black-and-white-aerial-imagery-captured-in-2003-for-cook-county-illinois-at-6-inch-pixel-resolution-the-imagery-was-taken-with-panchromatic-film-which-is-film-sensitive-to-all-wavelengths-of-visible-light-and-capable-of-high-spatial-resolution-the-cook-county-imagery-dating-from-1998-is-discoverable-in-the-geoportal-cook-county-government-makes-the-data-available-through-the-cook-central-open-data-portal-as-a-web-service-and-as-a-downloadable-data-set-what-btaa-library-submitted-the-item-university-of-chicago","title":"Featured Item: Aerial Imagery: Cook County, Illinois, 2003 #### What is the item?

That imagery is high resolution, so we'll use it in-house as well to create features for other data sets that are visible in the photos. In between imagery projects, we may import or georeference development plans for significant changes. If imagery isn't available, we'll align features to other known locations. Depending on the data, we'll have a hierarchy of available data to use. MarkUps from paper or digital maps can still be effective. In those cases, it can be an iterative process where we digitize the features and send it back to the subject expert for review.

Building on the popularity of the historic 1937-1941 aerial photos of Wisconsin, (one of the most popular resources in the B1G Geoportal for several years running) our current focus has been on enhancing discovery to more current aerial imagery and LiDAR elevation data currently housed within the WisconsinView repository. WisconsinView.org (part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s Space Science and Engineering Center) serves as the repository for remotely sensed data in Wisconsin -- from LiDAR and satellite imagery, to digital orthophotography, tornado and flood data.  </p> <p>In partnership with WisconsinView, the UW Robinson Map Library and WI State Cartographer\u2019s Office are working to write metadata and facilitate access to these collections via the B1G Geoportal. This work results in greater exposure to the data and imagery, and combines access to additional data and resources in the geoportal that may be useful in conjunction. LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth. Example derivative datasets from LiDAR include Digital Elevation Models (DEM), Digital Surface Models (DSM), derived terrain, contours, and classified point cloud data that can be interpreted in many ways. At present, there are nearly 700 LiDAR datasets for Wisconsin in the B1G Geoportal. </p> <p></p> <p>Sample LiDAR dataset for Columbia County, Wisconsin in 2011. </p> <p>Wisconsin is fortunate to have several sources of digital aerial imagery products (at varying resolutions) from federal, state, and local government sources. Aerial images from 2004-present now total over 1,500 datasets in the B1G Geoportal. Imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and Wisconsin Regional Orthophoto Consortium (WROC) make up a large percentage of the data available and can be accessed as countywide files or by digital ortho-quarter-quad (DOQQ) tiles. Easy-to-use indexes appear in the geoportal records to determine the appropriate desired tiles. Local imagery obtained by counties is also available, including this example of 3-inch resolution imagery for Iron County for 2020. </p> <p></p> <p>3-inch resolution imagery for Iron County in mrsid format from the B1G Geoportal. </p> <p>Future work will include adding additional historic aerial imagery collections from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Forestry Division, 2020 WI Regional Planning Commission aerial imagery, along with new high-resolution LiDAR data being acquired by Wisconsin counties each year. Look for Wisconsin imagery and elevation collections in the B1G Geoportal to grow at faster rates in the coming years as new data is made available.</p> <p>This was originally posted on blogger here.</p>","tags":["Wisconsin","featured collections","aerial photography","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2021/09/24/2021-09-featured-item-chicago-ethnic-group/","title":"Featured Item:  Chicago Ethnic Group Shapefiles 1868-1940","text":"<p> By Cecilia Smith.</p>","tags":["Featured items","demographics","Chicago","Illinois","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2021/09/24/2021-09-featured-item-chicago-ethnic-group/#what-are-the-items","title":"What are the items?","text":"<p>These shapefiles show generalized majority ethnic groups in areas across Chicago from 1868, 1884, 1898, 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1940. </p> <p>The map and historical information presented here include materials reflecting the attitudes, language, and stereotypes of an earlier time period.

We also collaborate heavily with local agencies &amp; governments in Michigan and the U. S. Census. To a certain degree, we are also engaged in public outreach. I manage the Geodata Team, which is part of Geospatial Services. We maintain the Michigan Geographic Framework (MGF) and manage the Open Data Portal. My team also provides geospatial consulting and support, specialty mapping and geocoding services, creates and maintains apps for state agencies and programs, works with local agencies, and provides boundary updates for the Census. For this post, we focus on the Michigan Geographic Framework. From its inception in 2000 and through MGF version 17, updates to the framework were made annually. We are currently working on the next generation MGF (version number to be decided, but let\u2019s say v21), which will be something entirely different. While the prior versions were static and updated annually, the new MGF will be dynamic. The Guiding Principles for the Michigan Geographic Framework Geospatial Data Hub:</p> <ul> <li>Create data once, use many times</li> <li>Data from authoritative sources</li> <li>Data classification by data owners</li> <li>Regular data updates and maintenance</li> <li>Effective metadata</li> <li>Partnerships and data sharing agreements</li> <li>Consistent data for decision making \u2013 local, state, federal, public </li> </ul>","tags":["data provider interview","michigan","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2021/11/03/2021-11-an-interview-with-tim-lauxmann-geodata/#how-do-you-create-the-geospatial-data","title":"How do you create the geospatial data?","text":"<p>The Michigan Geographic Framework is a hub of data that receives files from our data partners, such as other state agencies, the federal government, and Michigan county governments. MGF incorporates the processing power of the 1Spatial production engine to ingest authoritative GIS data from the data steward for that data. For example, our biggest data contributor is the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). As they have updates ready, they upload their linear reference systems (LRS) data through the portal we established for them. The 1Spatial engine processes datasets according to established business rules and incorporates them into MGF. After the initial upload, subsequent updates will only process areas identified during a change detection process and identify differences from what is already in the MGF. The process is complicated by the fact that there will be more than one contributor uploading the same type of authoritative data. In this case, local contributors (county level) will also be contributing road data. The 1Spatial business rules ensure that the data from the different contributors is processed such that we maintain one centerline. In the case of MDOT and local roads, MDOT geometry on any road that is in their LRS takes precedence over the local geometry. Conversely, local road attributes, such as the primary street name (i.e., what shows up on the street sign) and address ranges (which MDOT does not maintain but are essential for emergency services), are added to the attribute tables. This is just one example, but it illustrates how 1Spatial uses the MGF business rules to ensure data standards are maintained. </p> <p></p> <p>Guiding principles of MGF Geospatial Data Hub, example 1.</p>","tags":["data provider interview","michigan","legacy-blogger"]},{"location":"blog/2021/11/03/2021-11-an-interview-with-tim-lauxmann-geodata/#how-are-your-geospatial-datasets-distributed","title":"How are your geospatial datasets distributed?","text":"<p>Some datasets are sensitive in nature and are only accessible to qualified users who are subject to non-disclosure agreements.

We work collaboratively with many agencies to customize data outputs that they need to carry out their missions. One interesting example of the unique data needs of various government agencies is the complicated nature of political boundaries and how they affect elections and voting. Local governments can gain land by way of the annexation process. But Michigan has an unusual temporary variation known as a \u2018425\u2019 annexation. This can mean that land belongs to a unit of government for a period of 25 or even 50 years, then might revert back to a rural township. These agreements must be tracked carefully so that voters in those areas are assigned to the correct voting precinct. Within the wording of the annexation agreement (whether regular or 425), the disposition of voters is specified. This disposition is important to the Bureau of Elections because voting precinct boundaries can\u2019t extend outside municipal boundaries. On the other hand, for others, such as MDOT\u2019s Act 51 program and the Census Boundary and Annexations Program (BAS), what is important is the change to the municipal boundary, not the disposition of the voters. To juggle these needs in the past, my team maintained two sets of boundary data. With the new MGF, we will have one set of boundary layers and use attributes to output the required data for each stakeholder.

But also, examine possibilities for future content that would be more diverse. An easy example is language. Most content in the Geoportal is currently in English. How can you tell?

Members of the BTAA Geoportal recently examined our print collection of cataloged maps to determine the languages represented. This is not a complete picture, as many un-cataloged maps may be in non-English languages, but we wanted to carry out a preliminary analysis using readily-available data. </p> <p>So how did this shake out?</p> <ul> <li>Out of nearly 1.7  million maps in our sample, over 85% are in English.</li> <li>Over 75,000 maps were listed with an undetermined language, which may speak to examining them for this and other missing metadata.</li> <li>European languages by far dominated. For languages with over 1,000 maps, Japanese, Indonesian, and Chinese are the only non-European languages represented.</li> <li>Over 50 languages have 10 or fewer maps. More than 20 with just a single map. This points to some interesting possibilities for unique content that may be good candidates for future scanning projects.

A few ideas:</p> <ul> <li>Scanning projects for non-Western languages to expand the diversity of our digital collections. Japanese, in particular, has over 1,000 maps at a few BTAA members\u2019 libraries.</li> <li>Make corrections for incorrect or outdated language codes. This wasn\u2019t a significant number of items, but these are items that should be addressed in terms of how they are described in our catalogs.</li> <li>Look at updating language info for cataloged maps without a listed language. This helps users for our print collections but may show we have missing languages we might want to look at.</li> <li>Beyond scanning projects, could we make use of this information for local purposes? Perhaps collaborations with our area studies colleagues to support education and outreach activities?</li> <li>Working towards making sure that language is represented in Geoportal content metadata and searching.

The one-day conference included two keynote addresses, presentation sessions, lightning talks, a career panel, and a map gallery. 162 people registered for the conference, representing 47 unique institutions or affiliations. On the day of the conference, there were 96 unique attendees. A highlight of this year\u2019s conference was the two keynote addresses, and the talks described significant and inspiring projects/programs:</p> <ul> <li>American Domesday, by Dr. Robert Lee, discussed his newest work to spatially analyze public lands in the American West. After the conference, we added geoportal records for Lee\u2019s related work on \u201cLand Grab Universities.\u201d</li> <li>The Population Data Buffet, by Dr. Tracy Kugler, described the many types of population data with a focus on IPUMS.

So this means for language to be a valuable search/filter option, items need to have a language included in their metadata. Many currently don't. Most of these are very likely in English as they are geospatial data sources from various government entities in the US. But until we make sure and the change is made, the language for these items is essentially non-existent. So the people working with metadata would need to examine the language-less items to add the appropriate language to the item's metadata. This can be time consuming just because of the volume of items. But also, some items may be in a non-English language, but would the person looking at it know what that language is? So this is a lot more complicated than \"Look. Add Language. Look. Add Language\u2026..\" It's more like \"Look. English. Look. English. Look. What is that?

As the COVID-19 outbreak began, many researchers and bio-pharma around the world were working diligently to find a vaccine that potentially cures SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 global pandemic. Development of a successful vaccine would take several years and it is a tedious process that involves complex science, and thorough scrutiny by the government (i.e, authorizing body) before administering it to humans to prevent/cure disease. In-contrast to the traditional pipeline in  vaccine development, COVID-19 pandemic had led to an urgency in developing vaccines at record speed. In the past, not many people were interested in the vaccine development model/science and business until COVID-19 pandemic hit hard on humanitarian and economic development.  Figure 1: Vaccine Development Pipeline (source: theconservation.com) There are few organization/website that keep records of COVID-19 vaccine candidates including WHO COVID-19 Vaccine Landscape, Milken Institute COVID-19 vaccine tracker, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) Vaccine Center COVID-19 vaccine tracker and The New York Times Vaccine Tracker. However, these websites/tools lack information on scientific characteristics of vaccine candidates which is a key for analyzing biological components to understand the vaccines research. To overcome this, an interdisciplinary team from the University of Maryland Libraries and University of Notre Dame developed Vaccine Mapper that serves as a state-of-art web-based visual analytics platform to track COVID-19 vaccine candidates under study and their metadata analysis. The Vaccine Mapper, a data-discovery tool that features location of vaccine developers around the world with the key scientific information on their vaccine design, progress and other information. It was first launched to the public on May 20, 2020 that covered around 100 CVOID-19 vaccine candidates at different clinical stages.To date, the tool has tracked 284 candidates, for which many of them are still under study and only a handful of them are approved for emergency use. The team periodically collects information on vaccine candidates from various public sources to update the tool as appropriate. Figure 2: Vaccine Mapper- Vaccine Candidates page The Vaccine Mapper's record shows that there has been a huge diversity of vaccine candidates in development for a single disease that differ in terms of their development platforms, delivery systems, co-administered adjuvants, route of administration and manufacturing requirements. This record number of vaccine candidates provides one of a kind opportunity to determine the state of vaccine science, compare diverse vaccine development strategies, and identify emerging innovations as well as knowledge gaps in the field. The Vaccine Mapper has two major interfaces: Vaccine Candidates (landing page) and Vaccine Design. The landing page has a map showing location of al COVID-19 vaccine developers globally, chart showing candidate's development stages, list of developers that are awarded Operation Warp Speed, candidates publication where applicable etc. Whereas, Vaccine Design tab emphasis on vaccine development platform, delivery system and delivery route with graphs and charts.  Figure 3: VaccineMapper: Vaccine Design page This tool is user-friendly and allows audiences to discover information on COVID-19 vaccine candidates and their biological characteristics. The mapper features essential information products like, maps, graphs, charts and lists that are interactively linked to allow users to filter data to get the answers they want. For example, within the Vaccine Design tab, if a user selects the section of the pie chart showing mRNA under the vaccine development platform that automatically refines charts for the vaccine delivery system and routes (Fig. 4).  Figure 4: VaccineMapper: Vaccine Design parameter filtering This web tool was built using ArcGIS Online Dashboard- a cloud geospatial infrastructure powered by ESRI that supports location-based analytics using interactive data visualizations. A frequently updated version of Vaccine Mapper is available on Github: https://github.com/SiwoResearch/vaccinemapper. Direct link to VaccineMapper: https://vaccinemapper.nd.edu.

The Wabash River Basin, which covers most of Indiana and adjacent portions of Illinois and Ohio, was highly prone to flooding before this time.  A 1933 report by the United States House Committee on Harbors and Rivers estimated the annual average cost of flood damage in the basin at $2,000,000 (roughly equivalent to $60,000,000 today) (page 9). The creation of Lake Monroe formed part of a basin-wide solution. </p> <p></p> <p>Comparison of topographic map from 1975 study with the United States Geological Survey\u2019s 1947 7.5-minute series topographic map of \u201cAllens Creek Quadrangle, Indiana (Monroe County).\u201d </p> <p>Although the lake helped with regional flooding issues, by the early 1970s, several local problems began to emerge. Lake Monroe had become a valuable water source for the growing Bloomington and Bedford communities. It also served as a major center of commerce due to its attractiveness as a tourist and recreation site, which in turn increased demand for building residential and commercial developments in the area. The popularity of the lake raised concerns that human activities would accelerate its eutrophication and that \u201cthe usual resultant problems of prolific weed and algal growth, deteriorating fisheries, impaired water quality, and sediment infilling\u201d would pose serious threats to the lake (Gray, et al., page 10). To better assess these issues, a land suitability study was designed \u201cto provide a source of reliable information regarding the geology, ecology, land use, and institutional arrangements in the Lake Monroe Region\u201d (Gray, et al., page i). The study involved over a dozen government organizations at the local, state, and federal level, as well as two corporations (Cook and Caslon Development), and was carried out by 21 Indiana University faculty members representing the Indiana Geological Survey, School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Department of Zoology, Department of Geography, and the School of Law. The result of the study was a multidisciplinary 460-page report accompanied by four folded maps, including the one featured here showing the \u201cintricate topography\u201d of the Lake Monroe watershed with its \u201cmany interlacing ridges and ravines\u201d (Gray, et al., page 27).

The purpose was to help city planning and other officials understand the high quality land resources in their area [and thereby avoid  if possible in future urban growth projects]. As the multi-year project unfurled, it prioritized counties experiencing rapid land use change. </p> <p>Map production continued into the early 1980s but then took a turn for the worse. The project fell far short of the intended 1,200 counties - perhaps the recession of the early 1980s had something to do with that. And somehow, the maps also escaped widespread distribution through the Federal Library Depository network. Most maps produced by Federal government agencies are widely distributed and one can expect hundreds of copies to be available in libraries across the country. These maps, however, remained fairly obscure with just a few counties available in scattered collections. Recently the Big Ten Academic Alliance member libraries came to realize that each institution owned only parts of the collection. Through the Geospatial Information Network, they planned a project to scan and make available online each library\u2019s collection, indexing them all together in the Big Ten Geoportal. So far, 36 counties in Michigan have been submitted, with more expected in the future from other states. The maps will be gathered into a collection called Important Farmland Map Collection. </p> <p></p> <p>Caption: Important and unique farmlands are highlighted in the rapidly growing area between Grand Rapids and Zeeland, Michigan.

This is a common problem for geospatial data! If you work with geodatabases but sometimes share data in alternate file formats, this post is especially for you.  Geodatabases are popular among GIS researchers, but there are a limited number of software in which they can be opened. Because of this, it is a common practice to convert feature classes into shapefiles when archiving or sharing data. Shapefiles have substantial limitations, however, which can lead to loss of data and functionality during file conversion. You may have come across the truncation (and frustration) that can result from the 10 character limit on field names. There are many other limitations shapefiles have that are more difficult to notice, including limitations on the length of text fields and lack of support for time within date fields. It is easy to unintentionally alter a dataset while trying to make it accessible to a broader audience! </p> <p> Caption: The tables in this figure show what can happen if you convert a date field from a geodatabase into a shapefile.\\</p> <p>In the example, hours, minutes, and seconds have been removed from the shapefile version of the date field. Also, the field name in the geodatabase (\"date_sampling_test\") has been truncated to 10 characters (\"date_sampl\") in the shapefile version. The Geospatial Data Curation Toolkit helps with this and other challenges that arise when archiving data. The <code>GeodatabasetoShapefileWarnings</code> tool generates a report describing what will be lost when converting data layers between geodatabase and shapefile formats. The toolkit also includes tools to:</p> <ul> <li>create an inventory of the data layers and fields in geodatabases</li> <li>check for missing file extensions and whether all shapefiles in a folder use the same projection </li> </ul> <p>The toolkit is available on GitHub! You can download the files by clicking on the green \"Code\" button and choosing \"Download Zip.\" You will also find instructions about how to run the tools, a more detailed description of what they do, and sample reports.

Such restrictions are widely understood to constitute the root cause of racial segregation and lasting disparities in racial wealth, and the foundation of local and federal policies that succeeded them. And yet, because the restrictions themselves are buried in local property records, they have proven difficult to document. </li> </ul> <p>St. Louis Deed Book 1121-525 (1893), p3. </p> <p>In some settings (including Minneapolis), the digitization of records has enabled \"distant reading\" through optical character recognition. In St. Louis City and St. Louis County, however, the records are unevenly digitized and\u2014for the era of private restriction\u2014largely handwritten. So we needed a different research strategy. We were able to exploit a wrinkle in local recording conventions: In Missouri, as in a few other settings, county recorders not only documented restrictions in individual deeds, but also required developers and realtors to file \"master agreements\" covering entire subdivisions or neighborhoods. In both St. Louis and St. Louis County, such agreements are filed with a regular run of deed records or plat maps. Additionally, they are indexed separately from the \"grantor and grantee\" index that otherwise governs the organization of deed books. In St. Louis City, this was by one of the local title companies; in St. Louis County, this was by the recorder themselves. </p> <p></p> <p>Crestwood (1928), Plat Book 26-25 </p> <p>In each jurisdiction, we collected the effective date, language, terms, and scope of each restrictive indenture or agreement. Using the current county assessor or recorder shapefile of property parcels, we used stable legal descriptions (common to historical and current records) to match historical restrictions to current parcels. This enabled us to map the trajectory and reach of private racial restrictions, from their earliest iterations in the late nineteenth century, through the explosion of their use in response to the First and Second Great Migrations (especially during the housing boom of the 1920s), to the abrupt decline in the practice after the Supreme Court decision in Shelley v Kraemer (1948). </p> <p></p> <p>Racial Restrictions in Greater St. Louis, 1870 - 1952 </p> <p>Starting from these linked data in shapefile format, we endeavored to build an interactive map of the nearly 100,000 restricted parcels in St. Louis and St. Louis County. Mapping such a large quantity of data proved initially to be a challenge. Early efforts at producing an interactive map using Leaflet JS to pull from large files in GeoJSON format resulted in slow loading and sluggish map responsivity to the interactive elements, like the time slider, hover-activated tooltip, layer control, and zoom button. To avoid having to separate the map into city and county partitions, we opted to convert the GeoJSON data into vector tiles and handle the resulting tile set with another open-source map-oriented JavaScript library, MapLibre GL JS. With vector tiles, the map can shed unseen data and simplify polygons at smaller map scales. This allowed us to plot the full collection of restricted private parcel data without crashing the application, thereby providing the public with an uncomplicated visual account of racial segregation in Greater St. Louis that would otherwise remain concealed in overwhelming volumes of handwritten deeds and subdivision agreements. </p> <p></p> <p>Real Estate Advertisement Promoting \"Careful Restrictions\" and \"Desirable Neighbors\" </p> <p>These private restrictions were an important source of segregation and housing occupancy in their own right, setting the terms of racial occupancy in northern and border cities across a half century of dramatic urbanization and migration. It also served as the foundation for durable inequalities. In part, this was because its base assumptions\u2014about property values, land use, and neighborhood homogeneity\u2014were emulated and entrenched by local zoning and federal housing policies. In part, this was because, in the American context especially, so much else\u2014including educational opportunity, economic mobility, and intergenerational wealth\u2014flowed from those housing investments.

Range Shifts Predicted with Climate Change in a Common North American Songbird","text":"<p>Susan Reed, Indiana University Bloomington</p> <p>With a net loss of 3 billion North American birds since 1970, and 2.5 billion being native migratory birds, it is critical to investigate population dynamics and threats to species that impact abundance 1 and geographic distribution across space and time. Predicting species range in response to variation in climate is a goal shared among the fields of both conservation and evolutionary ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are visual representations of simulated spatial and temporal patterns of a species in response to predictor variables (PVs), making them useful tools for predicting a species\u2019 range for extrapolated future climate scenarios. As rapid environmental change is experienced, animals must adapt to changes in their environment at a minimum of the same rate, lest they risk extinction. Range shifts and adjustments in movement strategies are mechanism of coping with climate change, and SDMs give insight into how these mechanisms may play out in natural populations\u2014information that may be used to forecast population dynamics and persistence. A better understanding of where, when, and how species distributions are shaped provides valuable information to conservation practitioners, evolutionary ecologists, and policy makers for decision-making regarding habitat and species management. Here, I use ArcGIS Pro2 software to demonstrate SDMs of climate niches for a common migratory North American songbird, the slate-colored dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), utilizing contemporary and extrapolated climate scenarios to model changes in its range as it experiences climate change.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#2-estimating-urban-rooftop-solar-power-production-potential-in-chicago","title":"2.

Deep learning-based tree species identification using UAV RGB images*","text":"<p>Yunmei Huang, Purdue University</p> <p>Information at the species level is necessary for precision forest management and biodiversity conservation. However, it remains a challenging task with traditional remote sensing techniques because of the limit in imaging resolution. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, are getting more attentions for their low-cost and high-resolution advantages. However, most of the studies focusing on UAVs images for tree species identification are based on multispectral, hyperspectral images or combined with LiDAR data. The gap exists in using UAVs RGB data to identify tree species at the stand-level in forests with various species, especially for temperate forests. In this study, we built a  species dataset using high-resolution canopy images (3-5 centimeters)  collected by drones from different seasons. Transfer learning techniques were used to test the performance on specie identification using ResNet18, YOLOv5, and EffcientNetb0, which achieved accuracies above 98% among 4 species including northern red oak, black cherry, and white oak.

Previous research has repeatedly found that family socio-economic status is related to individuals\u2019 health through multiple pathways, like nutrition intake, social and emotional functioning, and adoption of health risk behaviors. Meanwhile, community environments, like community crimes, green spaces, and access to public health services, are also important to people\u2019s health. In medical sociology, the interacting effects of social factors on the individual level and resources on the community level on individuals\u2019 health have been explored. However, it usually lacks a view of geography due to the limitation of data or methodology skills. This study aims to apply GIS to the field of medical sociology to better understand the pattern of how health is influenced. The City of Chicago provides resourceful data on health and neighborhood characteristics. I propose to combine the Healthy Chicago Survey on individuals living in poverty and the environmental data regarding green spaces, crimes, race/ethnicity segregation, education, etc. to explore is there is a moderating, say a protective, effect on community/neighborhood level environment on the negative effect of low socioeconomic on individuals\u2019 health outcomes, including physical inactivity and serious psychological distress.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#justice-and-social-geography","title":"Justice and Social Geography","text":"<p> 10:00 - 11:00 CST (11:00 - 12:00 EST)</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#reconstructing-historical-neighborhoods-from-historic-sanborn-maps-using-machine-learning","title":"Reconstructing Historical Neighborhoods from historic Sanborn Maps Using Machine Learning","text":"<p>Harvey Miller, Center for Urban and Regional Analysis / The Ohio State University; Yue Lin, CURA/Ohio State; Ningchuan Xiao, CURA/Ohio State; Gerika Logan, CURA/Ohio State </p> <p>The building of the interstate highway system in US cities in the 20th century split and sometimes destroyed entire neighborhoods, mostly those housing African Americans, immigrants and other minorities. Planners of the system routed some highways, often purposely, through vulnerable and deprived neighborhoods occupied by people of color.

Although it is widely documented that internet availability is inconsistent across rural areas, pockets of neighborhoods in urban areas also lack access. We used the example of Milwaukee, Wisconsin a historically segregated city to show how Federally sanctioned residential segregation in the 1930\u2019s is still reflected in health inequities in socioeconomic health metrics today. We used ArcGIS Pro to map several community socioeconomic metrics such as children in poverty, homeownership rates, and those who have completed high school, as well as historically redlined neighborhoods, against access to high-speed broadband to show the spatial patterns. We then transformed these maps into several GIFs, shared in an article on the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps website and social media platforms, to help users better overlay the different metrics. We find, unsurprisingly, that census tracts with lower percentages of broadband access are correlated with those in which more children live in poverty, fewer individuals own their homes or graduated high school, and were more likely to be redlined in the past. These findings highlight the existence of digital redlining and point to the need to reduce the inequity in broadband access to avoid further harm to communities experiencing disinvestment. </p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#overcoming-the-challenges-of-developing-a-geospatial-database-for-longitudinal-study-of-urban-childhood-obesity","title":"Overcoming the challenges of developing a geospatial database for longitudinal study of urban childhood obesity","text":"<p>David Tulloch, Rutgers University; Kristen Lloyd, Rutgers University; Michael Yedidia, Rutgers University; Derek Delia, Rutgers University; Robin DeWeese, Arizona State University; Francesco Acciai, Arizona State University; Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, Arizona State University</p> <p>Childhood obesity is a complex problem to which a child's environment contributes significantly. Translating the dynamic urban realities of both the food environment and physical activity (PA) environment into consistently measurable variables is a challenging GIS problem, especially in cities with limited municipal data infrastructure. Using proximity as an indicator of access, we created an unique longitudinal dataset for this project which led to a variety of important findings about childhood obesity and access to parks and corner stores, perceptions about safety impacting walkability, and the value of developing an early habit of walking or biking to school. Since 2008, our research team built a routinely updated database representing the dynamic food environment of Camden, Newark, New Brunswick and Trenton, New Jersey. Updates included mapping corner stores, groceries, fruit and vegetable store, bakeries, butchers, supermarkets, as well as fast-food and full-service restaurants. While general food outlet data is acquired from various sources, to be valid each year\u2019s entry needs to be checked with direct contact and using supplementary information sources (e.g. external locational data). Simultaneously, the team mapped the physical activity environment, including parks and PA facilities (like gyms). The database also includes upgrades to community PA features (like parks, trails), extracting information from city agencies, project grants and other public sources.  This presentation will provide a brief overview of the key contributions of GIS to this 15-year collaboration of multidisciplinary multi-institutional childhood obesity research. It will then focus on the geospatial challenges encountered and lessons learned.</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#climate-and-carbon","title":"Climate and Carbon","text":"<p>11:15 - 12:00 CST (12:15 - 1:00 EST)</p>"},{"location":"conference/2022/agenda/#conference-recordings","title":"Conference Recordings","text":"<p>BTAA GIS Conference 2022 Planning Committee</p> <ul> <li>Karen Majewicz (Chair), Geospatial Product Manager, University of Minnesota, majew030@umn.edu</li> <li>Tara Anthony, GIS Specialist, Penn State University, tll38@psu.edu</li> <li>Caroline Kayko, Map and Geospatial Data Librarian, University of Michigan, ckayko@umich.edu</li> <li>Shirley Li, GIS Analyst, Purdue University, li1050@purdue.edu</li> <li>Laura Kane McElfresh, Cartographic Metadata Librarian, University of Minnesota, mcelf008@umn.edu </li> <li>Theresa Quill, Map and Spatial Data Librarian, Indiana University, theward@indiana.edu</li> <li>Josh Sadvari, Geospatial Information Librarian, Ohio State University, sadvari.1@osu.edu</li> <li>Nicole Scholtz, Librarian for Geospatial and Numeric Data, University of Michigan, nscholtz@umich.edu</li> <li>Amanda Tickner, GIS Specialist, Michigan State University, atickner@msu.edu</li> </ul>"},{"location":"conference/2023/","title":"2023","text":""},{"location":"conference/2023/#call-for-proposals","title":"Call for proposals","text":""},{"location":"conference/2023/#agenda","title":"Agenda","text":""},{"location":"conference/2023/#map-gallery","title":"Map Gallery","text":""},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/","title":"2022 Map Gallery","text":""},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#interactive-maps","title":"Interactive Maps","text":""},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#my-math-and-english-story-imme-an-illustrated-guide","title":"My Math and English Story (IMME): An Illustrated Guide","text":"<p>Elizabeth C.

However, to the author\u2019s knowledge, only one such database utilizes a geographic information system (GIS) map to visualize where incidents are located throughout the United States (U.S.) and Canada. However, location accuracy of these incidents is wide ranging. Upon further analysis, multiple locations were linked to the same injury report. While useful for providing a visualization of where an incident occurred, little to no data processing has been done for this database map. Furthermore, no GIS analysis of this data has been undertaken, to the author\u2019s knowledge. The objective of this research was to identify and visualize contextual relationships between farm-related incidents and emergency response time. An initial research hypothesis was that response time to farm-related incidents would increase with increasing distance from emergency medical services (EMS) and cellular tower proximity.  </p>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#static-maps","title":"Static Maps","text":"<p>Tip</p> <p>Click the thumbnails to pan and zoom the images.</p> <p>**Map Gallery Coordinator: Caroline Kayko (ckayko@umich.edu), University of Michigan **</p>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#relations-between-covid-19-and-used-territory-human-development-and-uneven-development-parameters-in-mesoamerica-and-the-caribbean","title":"Relations between COVID-19 and used territory, human development and uneven development parameters in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean","text":"<ul> <li>**Luis F.

As we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, local public health departments, school boards, and city councils make decisions that influence health factors and outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand the relationships between locality and health. However, the average health of a place may not represent all people living in that place. To quantify potential place-based race/ethnicity disparities, we calculated population-weighted between group variance (BGV) with each county\u2019s average age-adjusted mortality rate as the reference value. We then normalized each BGV value and assigned percentile and color groupings. As shown in the map, we did not calculate BGV for counties with missing or suppressed age-adjusted mortality rates for more than two race/ethnicity identity groups. Most counties with missing BGV values are predominantly white and have small population size. This is a sticky problem - lack of available data does not necessarily mean lack of disparity! For counties that have BGV values, race/ethnicity disparities appear visually to be worse in 2020 than in all prior years. This is likely due to differential rates of mortality from COVID-19 across race/ethnicity identities resulting from structural inequities and historical healthcare gaps. We use this map to illustrate the difficulties of assessing place-based health disparities on a national scale and to emphasize the need for greater identity and place-specific health data.  </p>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#mapping-thermal-regimes-for-a-wild-bird-expanding-its-range-south","title":"Mapping thermal regimes for a wild bird expanding its range south","text":"<p>Mary Woodruff, Indiana University</p> <p>Climate change is dramatically altering conditions. 80% of animals are shifting their ranges northward or to higher altitudes in response to rising temperatures, but the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) is expanding its North American breeding range to warmer, southeastern US climates. It remains unclear, however, the degree to which temperatures in this expansion would be considered \u2018hot\u2019 for a tree swallow. To address this, I asked: (1) What areas have experienced frequent \u2018hot days\u2019 in the last decade? (2) How have patterns of \u2018hot days\u2019 changed over time? I defined a \u2018hot day,\u2019 as when a tree swallow chick initiates behavioral and physiological thermoregulation. My previous research has demonstrated that chicks thermoregulate (i.e., pant and upregulate heat shock proteins) when nest temperatures reach 38\u00b0C \u2013 equivalent to 26\u00b0C air temperatures because bird houses are hotter than ambient. Therefore, days with maximum air temperatures above 26\u00b0C were considered \u2018hot.\u2019 To assess temperature patterns over time, I calculated the total number of \u2018hot days\u2019 during tree swallow breeding (April-June) from 2012-2022 using ERA5 data. I present maps showing (1) the percent of \u2018hot days\u2019 and (2) an emerging hot spot analysis of \u2018hot days.\u2019 These data show that birds breeding in North and South Carolina face frequent and consistent \u2018hot days.\u2019 Further, populations may differ in thermal tolerance across the range expansion. Future work will measure markers of thermal tolerance across populations, ultimately informing how birds are responding to climate change and laying the foundation for work exploring the evolution of thermal resilience. </p>"},{"location":"conference/map-gallery/2022/#real-working-patterns-in-hong-kong","title":"Real Working Patterns in Hong Kong","text":"<p>Jusphonia LS Ho, University of Wisconsin-Madison</p> <p>It is a longform infographic map describing the weekly working hours among Hong Kong people.

The work was done using the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), which divides land into six-mile square townships and one-mile square sections. It established the township, range and section grid; the pattern upon which land ownership and land use is based. The aim of the survey was to divide the land into lots that could be sold, or otherwise divested, to raise funds for the federal government and to encourage settlement. In general, this work took place near the end of the 18th century and throughout the 19th century. Survey dates for specific plats vary depending on the state/region.</p> <p>The survey work was done by the General Land Office (GLO), an agency of the Treasury Department until 1849 and thereafter a part of the Interior Department. In 1946, the GLO was merged with the Grazing Service to create the modern Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which continues to have responsibility for the Public Land Survey on public domain lands.

However, the lack of standard policies at this level of government means that this data can be considered ephemeral, as providers regularly migrate, update, delete, and re-publish data without saving previous versions and without notification to the public.<sup>4</sup></p> <p>The BTAA Geoportal fills a gap in the geospatial data ecosystem by cataloging metadata records for current publicly available state, county, and municipal geospatial data. Because the BTAA Geoportal indexes geospatial data on a monthly basis, we have discovered that the rate at which this ephemeral data disappears is rapid.<sup>5</sup> This continual turnover creates a difficult environment for researchers to properly source data and replicate results, and it prevents researchers from conducting longitudinal studies that examine change over time for a region.

This paper identified geospatial data as a long-term, interdisciplinary need that would necessitate increasingly complex infrastructures to manage.

With the growing number of GIS datasets and digitized historical maps available, it can be challenging to locate the right resources since they are scattered across various platforms and not always tagged with the necessary metadata for easy discovery. To address this issue, the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project launched in 2015 to connect scholars with geospatial resources.</p> <p>One of the primary outputs of the project is the BTAA Geoportal, a comprehensive index of tens of thousands of geospatial resources from hundreds of sources. The Geoportal enables users to search by map, keyword, and category, providing access to scanned maps, digital GIS data, aerial imagery, and interactive mapping applications. All of the resources available through the Geoportal are free and open, and the scanned maps cover countries around the world. Most of the data in the catalog is sourced from local governments, such as states, counties, and cities.</p> <p>The Geoportal is a useful tool because finding local geospatial data through a simple Google search can be difficult due to the lack of visibility of these datasets. The problem is that users need to know which agency is responsible for creating and distributing the data they are looking for and visit that agency's website to access the datasets. For instance, if you are researching a particular neighborhood in a city and need data on the roads, parks, parcels, and city council ward boundaries, you might need to check different state agencies, the city or the county website. But with the Geoportal, you can easily search by What, Where, and When without worrying about the Who or Why.</p> <p>The BTAA Geoportal helps scholars find and access geospatial resources from various sources, enabling them to focus on their research rather than the time-consuming task of finding the right data.</p>"},{"location":"technology/geoportal/#endorsements","title":"Endorsements","text":"<p>The following quotes are anecdotes from Task Force members about using the BTAA Geoportal</p>"},{"location":"technology/geoportal/#in-the-classroom","title":"In the Classroom","text":"<p>Quote</p> <p>Every semester I get invited to talk to a 200-level Geography course called \"Mapping your world\". I always highlight the Geoportal as a resource for finding spatial data as the students work on their end of semester group projects. Many of the groups research regional issues focused on the Midwest and have told me that they frequently use the Geoportal to find data. While new to mapping, students successfully find their data on the Geoportal, but they don't always realize what a valuable resource this is. However, an instructor who has been working in the field for decades really appreciates that so much spatial data has been aggregated into our Geoportal, and has been an advocate for the Geoportal in the classroom.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>A nursing department professor reached out to us with the idea to develop content using the Geoportal for an online course. We created a tutorial for students to search for public health data in the Geoportal and visualize it in ArcGIS Online. The students were from all over the country and interested in finding public health related datasets from their own states. In addition to the Minnesota datasets and scanned map featured in the tutorial, the students also found public health related datasets for Wisconsin, Michigan, and Maryland.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>I visited a Landscape architecture undergraduate class. For their capstone project, they needed to find information for a particular town or community of their own choice and design a new feature (such as parks, service center, etc.) according to their instructor. Many students (including international students) wanted to choose their out-of-state hometown for the project, but might not have known what agency or website to visit to find the information.

These tutorials cover a wide range of activities designed to meet the needs of instructors and students in a wide range of disciplines and levels of competency in geospatial data retrieval, use, and analysis.</p> <p>Types of Geospatial Information, by Nicole Kong at Purdue University, introduces students to the most commonly used types of data in GIS. Using a range of visual and diagrammatic examples, it reviews the different data models that GIS professionals typically use to collect and share information, and which are discoverable through geodata portals.</p> <p>Find a Map, by Danny Dotson at Ohio State University, is designed to help students locate a map for a given topic and use it in a document. This tutorial reviews the steps required to locate a relevant map, using the BTAA Geoportal, how to download or copy the scanned map, how to insert the map into a given document, and provides an overview of basic fair use and copyright implications for using these maps.</p> <p>Find Geospatial Data, by Joshua Sadvari at Ohio State University, is intended to help geoportal users frame a search strategy and perform a search for geospatial data. The tutorial is divided into two activities designed to teach students how to access relevant geospatial data using the BTAA Geoportal based on their research or assignment objectives.</p> <p>Evaluate Geospatial Information, by Ryan Mattke at the University of Minnesota, is designed to help students evaluate geospatial data on the BTAA Geoportal for research and coursework. This tutorial reviews how to determine if metadata exist for a resource, how to review this metadata to understand the data\u2019s authority, quality, and relevance, and where to find citation information for resources found with the geoportal.</p> <p>Use GIS Web Services, by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, is meant to give GIS users a basic understanding of GIS web services, how to find them using the BTAA Geoportal, and how to use them in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Pro. The tutorial also contains a link to a walkthrough demonstrating how to use GIS web services to create an interactive web map with Leaflet.</p> <p>Link Tabular Data to Geospatial Data, by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, provides step-by-step instructions for downloading and visualizing spreadsheet data in ArcGIS Online by linking tabular data to geospatial data with a key index variable. More specifically, the tutorial gives an overview of how to locate and download a Wisconsin county boundaries shapefile and a data table of population for each county from the US Census Bureau. The tutorial then explains how to prepare the data, add these files to ArcGIS Online, and join the Census data to the county shapefile using the matching county names column in both files. Finally, the tutorial introduces how to symbolize the joined data using county population.</p> <p>Georeference, by Wenjie Wang at the University of Illinois, guides ArcMap users through the steps of georeferencing a scanned historic map of Hyde Park, Chicago. Georeferencing allows GIS users to employ scanned maps as thematically appropriate base maps for geospatial data. It is a particularly useful skill for historical work requiring GIS analysis and mapping. This tutorial explains how to select an appropriate projection, how to add and evaluate control points, how to run the rectification process, how to evaluate the results by making the scanned overlay semi-transparent, and how to publish your output as a tiled map service on ArcGIS Online. Publishing a georeferenced map in this manner allows for easy sharing over the web as well as convenient application in user-interactive web mapping.</p> <p>Digitize, by Nicole Kong at Purdue University, introduces how to use ArcGIS Pro to convert data in raster format, such as scanned maps or aerial imagery, into vector data, like points, lines, and polygons. Through the tutorial, students will get a brief overview of common digitization techniques, including preliminary evaluation of the raster data source, creating new feature classes by using different snapping methods and construction tools in ArcGIS, how to modify created features, and how to add attributes to digitized features. The tutorial also includes an exercise worksheet to reinforce the learned techniques.</p> <p>Create Elevation Surface Models Using LiDAR, by Milan Budhathoki at the University of Maryland, introduces LiDAR datasets and point cloud processing in ArcGIS Pro. In this tutorial, students will download a LiDAR point cloud from the BTAA Geoportal of the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. They will learn how to load this data in ArcGIS Pro and view it over a 2D map and obliquely in 3D. Following this, students will learn how to symbolize the points so that vegetation and buildings can be extracted from the dataset. Students will also learn how to filter all ground points to create a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as well as to create a Digital Surface Model (DSM) from all the points.</p> <p>Build a GIS-Free Open-Source Zonal Stats Tool with Python in Jupyter Notebook, by Jay Bowen at the University of Iowa, teaches students with a basic knowledge of Python scripting how to make a free-standing zonal statistics tool that is not dependent upon desktop GIS software. This tool can be run on both MacOS and Windows and produces an input form to handle user inputs to determine the percent coverage of a given raster class range within a given polygon. For teachers and students who do not have time to download and install Anaconda-Navigator and Jupyter Notebook, there is a convenient step-by-step breakdown of the required code blocks that can be run in a Binder through GESIS Notebooks. This is particularly useful for those who want to gain a quick understanding of what the code does, but who do not have the capacity or desire to use storage space on their current computer. This tutorial is designed to initiate Python scripters to techniques for building their own GUI-driven GIS tools, which they can share with others who need simple user-friendly ways to analyze geospatial data.</p> <p>Story Maps, by Ryan Mattke at the University of Minnesota, introduces the process of creating a story map by using ArcGIS Online\u2019s StoryMaps interface. This tutorial covers many of the features within this tool that are not readily apparent as well as those that are not very intuitive. Some of these include how to add credits and content attribution, changing text formatting, adding buttons and separators, embedding media, and presenting media using immersive options. The tutorial also links learners to helpful resources for creating compelling story maps.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/01_types-of-geospatial-information/","title":"Types of Geospatial Information","text":"<p>Info</p> <p> Purpose: To introduce the most common types of data in GIS.</p> <p> Estimated time to complete: 30-40 minutes</p> <p> Prepared by: Nicole Kong, Associate Professor, GIS Specialist, Purdue University (kongn@purdue.edu). </p> <p> License: Except where otherwise noted, content in this tutorial is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/01_types-of-geospatial-information/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can use several different types of data.

Then, the code creates a new file called \u201craster2\u201d in the same directory as the input raster and sets the projection.</p> <pre><code>    file = gdal.Open(input_value_raster)\n    band = file.GetRasterBand(1)\n\n\n    # reclassification\n    classification_values = [0,low_class_int,high_class_int + 1]\n    classification_output_values = [0,1,0]\n\n    block_sizes = band.GetBlockSize()\n    x_block_size = block_sizes[0]\n    y_block_size = block_sizes[1]\n\n    xsize = band.XSize\n    ysize = band.YSize\n\n    max_value = band.GetMaximum()\n    min_value = band.GetMinimum()\n\n    if max_value == None or min_value == None:\n         stats = band.GetStatistics(0, 1)\n         max_value = stats[1]\n         min_value = stats[0]\n\n    # create new file\n    file2 = driver.Create( ras_dir_path + '/raster2' + file_ext, xsize , ysize , 1, gdal.GDT_Byte)\n\n    # spatial ref system\n    file2.SetGeoTransform(file.GetGeoTransform())\n    file2.SetProjection(file.GetProjection())\n</code></pre> <p>The following block of code assigns the newly defined classes to each pixel in the \u201craster2\u201d file by reading the input pixel values as an array and assigning new values based on a translation of classification breaks from the input \u201cclassification_values\u201d [0, 3, 7] to the output \u201cclassification_output_values\u201d [0, 1, 0].
