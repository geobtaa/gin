# Project Update: August 2019

<!-- more -->

## Highlights

The BTAA GDP has been gradually embracing the concept of the *code or
contribution sprint,* a short, fixed time period during which
participants focus on coding, troubleshooting, and creating new content.
During the month of August, members from the project participated in
three different sprints: the biannual two-week GeoBlacklight Community
Code Sprint, a one-day Communications sprint, and a one-week local code
sprint. This model of work resulted in many new features and content:

The GeoBlacklight Community Summer Code Sprint wrapped up with the
release of [GeoBlacklight version
2.2.](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
In addition to many bug fixes, the code base now includes several
features developed by the BTAA Geoportal: rollover help text, inline
SVGs for icons, and a plug-in for thumbnails. We also facilitated
contributions from non-developers to create more thorough metadata
documentation in the form of a
wiki.

The Communications Committee organized the first Communications
Sprint, which was attended by 6 Task Force members who wrote up 11
blog posts over the course of one day.

Lastly, our application developer worked with several Library staff
during the last week of August as part of a local code sprint. We
were able to upgrade the BTAA Geoportal to the latest version of
GeoBlacklight, make improvements to the image thumbnail resolutions and
citation widget, and explore a collective image server (IIIF) for the
project.
