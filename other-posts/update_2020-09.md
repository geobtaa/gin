BTAA GIS Conference

The Task Force is organizing the inaugural BTAA GIS Conference in November\. 

Although most of the participating universities already hold a “GIS Day” in the fall\, we wanted to create an online event that was a collective celebration for all BTAA members\.

The new conference will include presentations\, posters\, a map contest gallery\, and a virtual social/networking hour\.

IMLS Grant Application

Based upon recommendations from the Strategic Leadership Group \(2018\-2020\) and the BTAA Library Directors\, the project has identified two areas for future growth and sustainability: expanding our partnerships beyond the BTAA and implementing geospatial web services

To reach these goals\, we submitted a preliminary IMLS National Leadership Grant proposal in September
