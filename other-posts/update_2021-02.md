Project Highlight for February

Geospatial Library Community Events

The month of February was dominated by two events in the geospatial library community: Geo4LibCamp and the GeoBlacklight Winter Community Sprint\.

_[Geo4LibCamp](https://geo4libcamp.org/)_  is an annual unconference for anyone working with geospatial libraries\, including map librarians\, application developers\, researchers\, metadata specialists\, GIS technicians\, administrators\, and more\. Since the inception of Geo4LibCamp in 2015\, the BTAA\-GDP has been an active participant and leader in the unconference \- serving on the organizing committee\, leading unconference sessions\, and providing lessons learned for institutions who are new to spatial data infrastructures\.

The GeoBlacklight community holds a  _[sprint](https://geoblacklight.org/blog/2021/02/10/announcing-winter-sprint-2021.html)_  two times per year\. The most recent sprint was largely devoted to finalizing a major upgrade to the metadata schema and determining how it would be implemented in the application\. These initiatives were both led by BTAA\-GDP staff \(Karen & Eric\)\.
