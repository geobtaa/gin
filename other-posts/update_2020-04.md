Updates]{.ul}](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/about/activities/project-reports)

## April Highlights

-   We focused on growing the collection of records in the geoportal
    > this month, and topped 30,000 for the first time. This included a
    > large set of Original Public Land Survey maps from Wisconsin, as
    > well as a selection of Covid-19 related datasets.

## Looking Ahead to May

-   We will host the third project blog post sprint on May 1

-   Our 5-year impact report will be released in mid-May

-   Our highly successful Graduate Research Assistant for the past two
    > years will finally graduate and we will be onboarding a new hire.

## April Activities

### Application Development

-   Our Application Developer worked during the last week of April and
    fixed a few bugs and added a new custom field for licensed data,
    "Access Rights."

-   We also worked with Libraries Web Dev to upgrade JQuery to the
    latest version. Unfortunately, a bug in the new version was
    discovered and we had to downgrade again. Hopefully, the Javascript
    community will have addressed this by the next local sprint later in
    March.

-   More progress was made on the Metadata Editor (GEOMG). Several test
    records were created, loaded into the editor, and published to a
    test version of Solr.
