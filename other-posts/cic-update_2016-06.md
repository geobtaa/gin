# CIC Geospatial Data Discovery Project Update June 2016

<!-- more -->


## June Activities

### CIC Geospatial Task Force Meetings

Monthly, virtual meetings of the CIC Geospatial Task Force (members from
all participant institutions). Topics included:

-   Reporting out from conference presentations

-   Possible use of Omeka for digitized map metadata

-   Update on geoportal launch

### Finalizing Metadata Records

Metadata records were finalized for the launch of the geoportal in July.
At present, approximately 1,500 metadata records will be ingested by the
time of the public launch.

## Work in Progress

### Omeka for Digitized Maps

Following a thorough discussion, the decision was made to procure a
hosted version of Omeka for use in processing digitized map metadata.
The Metadata Coordinator met with the GIS Librarian from NYU about a
GeoBlacklight plugin he designed for Omeka and with the UMN Libraries
Metadata Strategist to discuss metadata strategies for digitized maps.

### GeoBlacklight Configuration

Configuration efforts continued on the development instance of
GeoBlacklight. In particular, project staff collaborated with UMN
Libraries Web Development staff on a redesign of the geoportal homepage
in order to improve the user experience.

The beta instance of the geoportal will be ready for a public launch in
mid-July.

## Next Steps

-   Launch the public (beta) version of the geoportal by mid-July

-   Prepare workflow documentation for digitized map metadata in Omeka
by the end of July

-   Continue processing the second round of metadata records

-   Form an Interface Steering Group by mid-August (to assess any needed
improvements and report out by the end of October)
