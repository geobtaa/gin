Project Highlight for April

Google Ad Campaign to reach new users

In anticipation of the increased traffic that occurs towards the end of academic semesters\, we experimented with a Google Ad Campaign to reach new users\. We set up three targeted pages:

The  _[homepage](https://geo.btaa.org)_  \(generated 538 new users between Apr 12\-May 4\)

A landing page as a search query for  _[Aerial Photography](https://geo.btaa.org/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=aerial+photography)_    \(generated 178 new users between Apr 22\-May 4\)

A landing page for the  _[Chicago Social Sciences Historical Map](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=12d-01)_  collection  \(generated 48 new users between Apr 28\-May 4\)

The total number of new users was 763\, and the cost of these campaigns totaled less that $200\.   _[See full report\.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKlwbLT172qacAdLMv76panauUaZhJ_6b6KMW4BKTB8/edit?usp=sharing)_

In the course of preparing for this campaign\, we gathered input from Task Force members on which items would benefit from ads\. These could serve as landing pages for future campaigns\.
