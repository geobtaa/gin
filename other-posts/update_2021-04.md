Project Highlight for April

__Google Ad Campaign to reach new users__

In anticipation of the increased traffic that occurs towards the end of academic semesters\, we experimented with a Google Ad Campaign to reach new users\. We set up three targeted pages:

The  _[homepage](https://geo.btaa.org)_  \(generated 538 new users between Apr 12\-May 4\)

A landing page as a search query for  _[Aerial Photography](https://geo.btaa.org/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=aerial+photography)_   __ \(generated 178 new users between Apr 22\-May 4\)__

A landing page for the  _[Chicago Social Sciences Historical Map](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=12d-01)_  collection  __\(generated 48 new users between Apr 28\-May 4\)__

__The total number of new users was 763\, and the cost of these campaigns totaled less that $200\. __  _[See full report\.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKlwbLT172qacAdLMv76panauUaZhJ_6b6KMW4BKTB8/edit?usp=sharing)_

__In the course of preparing for this campaign\, we gathered input from Task Force members on which items would benefit from ads\. These could serve as landing pages for future campaigns\.__
