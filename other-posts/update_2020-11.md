Project Highlight for November

_BTAA GIS Conference_

_We held the first _  _[BTAA GIS Conference](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/btaa-gis-conference-2020)_  _ on November 13\, 2020\. This virtual conference was co\-sponsored by Purdue University\, which provided the hosting and technical support\._

_The conference featured presentations\, social hours\, career networking\, a map contest\, a geo\-trivia night\, and an Open Humanitarian Mapathon\. We also highlighted GIS educational programs across the BTAA\. Over 400 people from 10 countries registered for the conference\. Each of the presentation sessions had approximately 50\-100 attendees\, while the late afternoon social hours featured about 15\-20 participants\._

_The idea for the conference was developed by _  _Nicole Kong_  _ \(Purdue University\)\, who also served as the chair\. This event gave our project a great deal of visibility\. One of the invited speakers\, Joseph Kerski\, followed up the conference by writing _  _[a post about the BTAA Geoportal on his blog\.](https://spatialreserves.wordpress.com/2020/11/30/a-review-of-the-big-ten-academic-alliance-geospatial-data-portal/)_
