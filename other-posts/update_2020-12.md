Project Highlight for December

Two New Working Groups: 

_Education Outreach \(phase 2\) _ and _ Diverse Collections_

_Our project has entered an exciting new phase in which we are increasing our efforts towards directly facilitating teaching\, learning\, and our service to the academic community\. This is evident in our two newest Working Groups \(WG\)\. _

_The _  _Education Outreach WG_  _\, which published _  _[six tutorials](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/tutorials)_  _ in the Fall of 2020\, has regrouped for a phase 2\. The WG plans to identify educational disciplines to be targeted for outreach \(ex\. public health\, urban planning\, environmental studies\, etc\.\)\, and follow up by identifying resources in the geoportal that could be useful to the selected disciplines\._

_The _  _Diverse Collections WG_  _ will kickoff in January and will be defining and assessing diversity across the geoportal collection\.  They will then identify thematic datasets and create collections of resources that could be useful in research and teaching on social\, racial\, economic\, and environmental justice topics_

_We plan to put GEOMG\, our custom metadata editor\, into production mode\. This will entail hosting it on a paid platform and integrating it with the Geoportal_

_Two BTAA Task Force members are serving on the GeoBlacklight Metadata Schema Workgroup\, which plans to release a new version of the schema in January\. This will be followed by a Winter Code Sprint to incorporate the new schema into the GeoBlacklight code base\._

The Communications Committee is gathering keywords for a Google Ads campaign to be run in spring 2021\. We will be looking to see if this experiment brings additional users to the Geoportal\.
