Project Highlight for December

__Two New Working Groups: __

_Education Outreach \(phase 2\) _ and _ Diverse Collections_

_Our project has entered an exciting new phase in which we are increasing our efforts towards directly facilitating teaching\, learning\, and our service to the academic community\. This is evident in our two newest Working Groups \(WG\)\. _

_The _  _Education Outreach WG_  _\, which published _  _[six tutorials](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/tutorials)_  _ in the Fall of 2020\, has regrouped for a phase 2\. The WG plans to identify educational disciplines to be targeted for outreach \(ex\. public health\, urban planning\, environmental studies\, etc\.\)\, and follow up by identifying resources in the geoportal that could be useful to the selected disciplines\._

_The _  _Diverse Collections WG_  _ will kickoff in January and will be defining and assessing diversity across the geoportal collection\.  They will then identify thematic datasets and create collections of resources that could be useful in research and teaching on social\, racial\, economic\, and environmental justice topics_
