Project Highlight for March

Anatomy of a Licensed Data Record

Licensed Data now in the Geoportal

The incorporation of licensed data in the geoportal has been a project goal since the beginning\. Our 2017 Continuation Proposal indicated that we hoped to explore this integration beginning in Year 3 of the project\. However\, challenges around mitigating authentication protocols\, providing access links\, and cataloging individual layers caused us to delay this goal\.  At the end of 2019\, we began gathering examples of licensed data and formed the Licensed Data Implementation Working Group to establish best practices for these kinds of resources\. This working group spent one year exploring options and gathering additional records before issuing a  _[final report\.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AFJqeAnJsPwdKv6ub1J8nu3ZgILNEBL8/view?usp=sharing)_

As of Mid\-March\, we now have published metadata records for 7 licensed databases in the geoportal\.  We also made over  _[900 metadata records](https://geo.btaa.org/?f%5Bdc_rights_s%5D%5B%5D=Restricted&q=&search_field=all_fields)_  for the individual layers and sets that can be found in those databases\.
