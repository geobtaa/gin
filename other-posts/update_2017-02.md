### External Communication

Project Metadata Coordinator worked to move the project website to the
[[new version of Google

post (with another Task Force Member) detailing the experience at
Geo4LibCamp at the end of January.

## Work in Progress

### Continuation Proposal

Project Lead is working with the local sponsors at Minnesota to draft a
continuation proposal for the project beyond June 2017 to be delivered
to the Project Sponsors in March.

### Digitized Maps

participating institutions to the Geoportal. Over the past several
months, over 1,600 digitized map
records
have been added.

## Next Steps

    > the end of March
