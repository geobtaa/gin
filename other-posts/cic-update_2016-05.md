# CIC Geospatial Data Discovery Project Update May 2016

<!-- more -->


## May Activities

### CIC Geospatial Task Force Meetings

Monthly, virtual meetings of the CIC Geospatial Task Force (members from all participant institutions). Topics included:

-   Status updates from each institution

-   Metadata Processing Goals and Deadlines

-   GeoBlacklight instance update

-   GeoNetwork update

### Omeka for Digitized Maps

The Metadata Steering Group initiated discussions around using Omeka as
the collaborative metadata editor for digitized map records. Further
investigation is ongoing as to the feasibility of setting up a dedicated
Omeka instance for the project.

### Promotion & Outreach

Task Force members presented about the project at various conferences in
May:

-   Upper Midwest Geospatial Conference (La Crosse, WI) ‒ Presentation
     on metadata and workflows

-   Upper Midwest Geospatial Conference (La Crosse, WI) ‒ Lightning Talk
     on project overall

-   Pennsylvania GIS Professionals Conference (University Park, PA) ‒
     Presentation

-   IASSIST (Bergen, Norway) ‒ Poster presentation on project overall

Task Force members also met with representatives from Esri who were
visiting Minnesota for a campus visit. The Esri representatives were
interested in hearing about the project and in any feedback regarding
the usefulness (or not) of their products in the project workflows.

## Work in Progress

### GeoNetwork Configuration

Work continued in May to configure GeoNetwork, the collaborative
geospatial metadata editor for the project. To date, over 7,250 records
have been added. These records will continue to be edited and
transformed for eventual inclusion in the geoportal.

In addition, the Metadata Coordinator implemented the functionality of
categories and workflows for records in GeoNetwork and created four new
web pages containing information on editing records in GeoNetwork.

### GeoBlacklight Configuration

Initial configuration of GeoBlacklight development and production
servers was completed. Task Force members at Minnesota are working with
UMN Libraries Web Development on homepage design and initial testing of
metadata record loads.

In addition, contact with the CIC has been made with the intention of
using geo.cic.net as the web address for the completed geoportal.

## Next Steps

-   Continue processing the second round of metadata records

-   Finalize workflows for including digitized maps in the geoportal by
     the end of June

-   Work with UMN Libraries Web Development to redesign the
     GeoBlacklight homepage by the end of June

-   Launch the beta version of the geoportal by the end of June
