<!-- more -->

## September Activities

### BTAA Geospatial Task Force Meetings

Monthly, virtual meetings of the BTAA Geospatial Task Force (members
from all participant institutions). Topics included:

-   Status Updates from institutions

-   Steering Group Updates

-   Metadata Curation Workflow presentation

### Project Update

-   There are currently 7,998 records in the Geoportal, an 6% increase
    over the previous month.

-   Usage Statistics (September 2017)

    -   Pageviews: 4,405

    -   Sessions: 693

    -   Unique users: 505

### Metadata Links Updated

Taking advantage of new GeoBlacklight functionality (for version 2.0 â€’
developed during the code sprint in July/August) for displaying metadata
as human-readable HTML, the Project Metadata Coordinator added new
metadata links to several thousand records in the Geoportal.

### Outreach and Promotion

Project Metadata Coordinator developed a blog
post that is reusable by all participating institutions to inform user
communities about the Geoportal.

Project Metadata Coordinator organized and co-led a GeoBlacklight
Community online meeting that was attended by active developers and
other interested parties, joined the
[[Geo4LibCamp]](http://geo4libcamp.org) Planning Committee, and
attended FGDC Metadata Working Group meeting

## Work in Progress

### Application Developer Activities

The Application Developer created a maintenance mode for the public
geoportal for use when performing updates, upgraded the Solr database
from 5.5 to version 6.6, modified code from Princeton to create a
potential new UI for displaying search results with thumbnails, full
titles, and descriptions, and modified code from Stanford to create a
potential new UI for the user to be able to toggle between a text
results list and a map display.

## Next Steps

-   Planning sessions for the December Summit

-   Explore the use of Kibana for visualizing and analyzing content in
    the Geoportal
