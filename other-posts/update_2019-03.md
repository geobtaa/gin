# Project Update: March 2019

<!-- more -->
## Highlights

During the last week of March, the Application Developer completed their
[second codesprint](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/projects/6) as an independent contractor and made several significant improvements to the geoportal. The site was upgraded to GeoBlacklight 2.0 which required new versions of Solr (the index) and Bootstrap, (HTML, CSS, and JS library that controls visual aspects, such as layout and font). The Solr upgrade process involved working with the Library Web Development department to install new Solr 7.7 cores, and with the
Metadata Coordinator to republish all of the geoportal's records. The
Bootstrap upgrade required the Application Developer to comb through the
code and manually fix issues with new variable names and to reapply
custom color and spacing designs. Additionally, several features, such
as Autosuggest and the Advanced Search plugin, needed troubleshooting in
order to continue functioning properly in the new version.

Although much of the work was "behind the scenes," the upgraded
geoportal brought new features that will improve user experience. The
first is a major improvement to the map search algorithm that now
prioritizes "best fit" for items that have bounding boxes close to the
map extent. The second is the implementation of a field that flags
records to be hidden from a search. This is useful for multipart items
with very similar metadata. Users will see a parent record in search
results and then access the children via an index map or the Related
Records widget. The field is also useful for hiding records that we want
to keep, such as those with broken access links, indicating that the
source host is updating the dataset or has retired it.

The project has continued to steadily grow and reached new landmarks
this month. After an influx of county datasets from Wisconsin and Ohio,
the geoportal hit a new threshold of 20,000 records, and Google
Analytics showed that March 2019 featured the highest number of unique
users (771) to date.
