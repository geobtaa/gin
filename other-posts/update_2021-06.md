Project Highlight for June

Aardvark: New Metadata Schema in production

After nearly a year in development\, the GeoBlacklight community has endorsed   _[a new metadata application schema \(MAP\)\, known as ‘Aardvark’\.](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight-metadata/blob/main/docs/aboutAardvark.md)_     This schema   incorporates additional fields for better descriptions of a wider range of resources\, as well as syntactical updates in order to improve interoperability between institutions and between other metadata standards\.

For the BTAA Geoportal\, this schema improves usability in several ways\. There are now established community guidelines for broadly categorizing   items with users in mind\. Users can filter by class \(ex\. Datasets\, Maps\) and by form \(LOC Cartographic genres or datasets geometry\)\. There are also new fields for Rights\, Relationships\, and File sizes\.

Many of these schema improvements came from customizations that the BTAA project already had in place\. However\, many other changes came from incorporating the needs of new GeoBlacklight adopters\. A GeoBlacklight Metadata Interest Group is ongoing\, led by the BTAA Project Manager\, and will continue to assess and refine the schema as needed\.
