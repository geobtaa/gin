## Highlights

### Geoportal Enhancements

Our application developer completed a May sprint to implement several
implemented several geoportal enhancements:

-   The geoportal\'s main menu was updated with links to external pages
    on a UMN Google Site. The new platform allows the Task Force to
    easily update the About, News, and Help pages with new content.

-   [Items with an ArcGIS geospatial web service now have a new button called "Open in ArcGIS." This opens the web service in the ArcGIS Online platform, where it can styled and added to a web map.
-   Index maps now have an icon a user can click to visit a help page
    describing how to use them.

### Analytics

The Product Owner and Project Lead consulted with Web Development on
continuing work on analytics for the geoportal. This resulted in a new
form of metadata export from the geoportal and plans for a simplified
Tableau interface to be debuted at the end of June.

The user analytics for the geoportal continued to rise, with May having
the largest user base so far at 952 users.
