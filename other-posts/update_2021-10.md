Project Highlight for October

Diverse Collections Working Group Presentation

The Diverse Collections Working Group presented during the  _[Western Association of Map Libraries Annual \(WAML\) Conference](https://waml.org/conferences/waml-2021/presentations/#collections)_ \. They discussed the origins and purpose of the group\, which was  to identify a process for defining and assessing diversity in the geoportal collections\, and to make recommendations for how diversity can be more purposefully considered and prioritized in future collection development decisions\. 

They also described their short\-term projects\, which have focused on language representation in map collections across Big Ten institutions\, a content and format review related to several aspects of the geoportal\, and   the   creation of a shared educational resource on critical cartography and geospatial data ethics\. Lastly\, they discussed ideas for how they hope to leverage their preliminary work into framing ongoing work through a lens of inclusion\, equity\, and social justice\.   _[View the presentation here\.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQE6KHrfWfWHGDoMCAfwagUzGZ9vu7pn6gRTxHSybk6SxzSf8QR0auBpi2Cqtclp4TtM8ARl3vMGu99/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)_
