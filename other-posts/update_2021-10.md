Project Highlight for October

Diverse Collections Working Group Presentation

The Diverse Collections Working Group presented during the  _[Western Association of Map Libraries Annual \(WAML\) Conference](https://waml.org/conferences/waml-2021/presentations/#collections)_ \. They discussed the origins and purpose of the group\, which was __ to identify a process for defining and assessing diversity in the geoportal collections\, and to make recommendations for how diversity can be more purposefully considered and prioritized in future collection development decisions\. __

__They also described their short\-term projects\, which have focused on language representation in map collections across Big Ten institutions\, a content and format review related to several aspects of the geoportal\, and __  __the__  __ creation of a shared educational resource on critical cartography and geospatial data ethics\. Lastly\, they discussed ideas for how they hope to leverage their preliminary work into framing ongoing work through a lens of inclusion\, equity\, and social justice\. __  _[View the presentation here\.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQE6KHrfWfWHGDoMCAfwagUzGZ9vu7pn6gRTxHSybk6SxzSf8QR0auBpi2Cqtclp4TtM8ARl3vMGu99/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)_
