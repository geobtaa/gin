Project Highlight for May

GEOMG: New Metadata   Editor Tool   in production

This month\, we implemented an integrated metadata management and editing tool into our production workflow\. This new tool\, GEOMG\, is a project that the Application Developer and the Project Manager/Metadata Coordinator have been working on for over a year\.

The new tool streamlines several aspects of our processing workflow including:

records can be batch imported and exported as CSV files

records can be exported as a variety of GeoBlacklight schemas as JSON files

individual records can be created or updated using a form\-based editor

records can be published or unpublished from Solr \(index for the BTAA Geoportal\)

the tool validates records upon upload for required elements\, duplicated IDs\, and malformed bounding boxes

We plan to continue refining GEOMG for our own use as well as to offer it as a plugin for the GeoBlacklight Community\. In the few weeks that it has been in production\, we have been able to process thousands of new records more efficiently and with better quality control\.
