# Project Update: February 2019

<!-- more -->

## Highlights

The first week of February 2019 brought the annual
[Geo4LibCamp](https://geo4libcamp2019.sched.com/) at Stanford
University. This is one of the best events for geospatial librarians,
GIS specialists, geography instructors, and application developers to
get together in person to discuss their respective needs and
troubleshoot solutions together. At this year's Camp, the Product Owner
moderated a panel about GeoBlacklight that included two Task Force
members, and they all co-led several [unconference
sessions](http://bit.ly/geo4libcamp2019-notes). We also advised
new attendees about potential collaborative efforts and how they might
be able to implement parts of a spatial data infrastructure,
particularly by using a discovery application like GeoBlacklight.

During the last week of February, the Application Developer completed
their first [codesprint](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/projects/6) for the project, which entails working as an independent contractor full time for one week per month. This codesprint was very productive and resulted in several bug fixes, testing and code improvements, as well as
implementations of automated processes. The automations were an
especially welcome enhancement, as the reduced schedule of the
Application Developer meant these would not get performed regularly
otherwise.

Our [Wisconsin Task Force member reached a major milestone this
month](https://twitter.com/UWRobinsonMap/status/1101500273841844224)
when they were finally able to make all of their county GIS data dating
back to 2014 freely open to the public. This means that over 1,200
previously restricted records were made public and added to our
geoportal collection, bringing our total number of records very close to
20,000.

        (nightly)

    -   [Checking broken
        links](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/issues/164)
        (monthly)

-   Testing and code improvements

    -   [CircleCI Continuous
        Integration](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/issues/181)

    -   [Rubocop](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/tree/feature/rubocop)
        and [DotEnv
        Implemented](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/issues/185) -
        makes Ruby code more consistent

    -   [Ruby 2.6.1
        Upgrade](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/issues/183) -
        This upgrade helped [fix a potential security
        vulnerability](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/issues/182)
        issue related to Bootstrap and SASS file processing within the
        project.

-   Bug Fixes

    -   [Leaflet Fullscreen
        Toggle](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/issues/174) -
        now working for all preview items

    -   [Sidebar Map
        Extent](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/issues/175) -
        now works for world extents

    -   [Remove Bookmarks Nav
        Link](https://github.com/BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/geoportal/issues/161) -
        removed unnecessary menu link


-   Upgrade to GeoBlacklight v2.0: This will be a significant effort.
    Beyond the typical release upgrade work, GBL v2 / BL v7 includes
    support for Bootstrap v4, which will require us to revisit every
    application view and layout customization made for the B1G/BTAA
    Geoportal.

-   Migrate Image Features to GeoBlacklight Sidecar Images: incorporate
    newest version of Rails 5.2 and Solr 7.7

-   Upgrade Apache Solr to v7.7+: Necessary to take advantage of the new
    GeoBlacklight 2.0 spatial search bbox overlapRatio feature.


-   Create position description for full time application developer

### Coordination & Documentation

-   Product Owner moderated a panel at Geo4LibCamp 2019 about
    GeoBlacklight that included two project Task Force Members

-   While at Geo4LibCamp, we worked with Esri and GeoBlacklight
    developers to implement a new "Open in ArcGIS Online" button.

### Collections

-   Added 9 new ArcGIS Hub portals (500 records)

-   Added 1267 new GIS records from Wisconsin

-   Added 21 records of census boundary files from NHGIS (the geospatial
    web services are hosted by Harvard)

-   Developed workflow for index maps and create 6 for Minnesota county
    atlases
