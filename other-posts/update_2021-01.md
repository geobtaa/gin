Project Highlight for January

_Graduate Research Assistants \(RAs\)_

_The project supplies funding for a full\-time Graduate Research Assistant \(RA\) each semester to aid the Metadata Coordinator\. This funding has supported five students from the University of Minnesotaâ€™s MGIS program since 2017\. Over the years\, three of these students extended their work with the project by signing up for internship or research credits_  _ to further develop their skills and broaden their resumes_  _\._

_Our current RA is Ziying \(Gene\) Cheng\, who has been editing the metadata for all of our incoming records since the Fall 2020 semester\, during which time she has made many improvements to our Python harvesting and editing scripts\. Gene has also signed up for internship credits for Spring 2021 to study application development\. She has begun learning Ruby on Rails and plans to participate in the upcoming GeoBlacklight Community Sprint\, as well as assist our Application Developer on a local sprint in April 2021\._

_Yijing \(Zoey\) Zhou was our Summer 2020 RA\, and she has stayed on to work with our project to complete both internship and directed studies credits\. Zoey has recently created a beta version of an interactive map depicting where our collections are located\. She is now focusing on leveraging the GeoNames API to retrieve bounding boxes\, place names\, and linked data URIs to improve and normalize spatial searching in the Geoportal\._
