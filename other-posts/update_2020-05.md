Updates]{.ul}](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/about/activities/project-reports)

## May Highlights

-   We held the 3rd project blog post sprint, which produced 10 new
    posts.

    report]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D20pCiBhUCl1G6hxml46HigpAMAQvGqG).

-   Work continued on the developing metadata toolkit. The biggest new
    feature is adding faceted search. This will help staff easily find
    and filter Geoportal documents to edit or remove.

  Faceted interface for finding records                                              Record editing view
