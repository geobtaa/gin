<!-- more -->

## Highlights

### New Committee Configurations

The four topical committees were reorganized at the beginning of July
with new chairs and some change in membership. All Task Force members
now serve on only one committee at a time. The Steering Committee used
their standing July meeting to hold an orientation for the incoming
chairs that included new documentation on their roles and
responsibilities.

### New Participants in the GeoBlacklight Summer Code Sprint

The GeoBlacklight Community Code Sprint commenced on July 29th with
several new participants. The BTAA GDP's application developer led a
session introducing code sprints and GitHub workflows, and the Product
Owner organized a group to update the metadata workflows on the
GeoBlacklight wiki pages.

### Fall SLG meeting scheduled (October 31-November 1)

The Strategic Leadership Group (SLG) will meet in person in Minneapolis
on October 31-November 1. The Task Force is preparing for this by
synthesizing the recent AUL/Dean interviews, compiling lists of licensed
geospatial data held at each participating Big Ten institution, and
investigating a shared web service platform. This research will be
compiled into reports for the SLG to review and determine potential next
steps for the project.
