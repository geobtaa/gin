### Coordination & Documentation

Project Metadata Coordinator published a blog post about the
GeoBlacklight Winter Code Sprint updated the [BTAA Geoportal About Us
page](https://geo.btaa.org/about) to include new data sources, and
developed an ArcGIS Open Data Portal Accession
Policy.

## Work in Progress

### Committees & Working Groups

Communication Committee met with Kim Armstrong to discuss developing
stories that relate to how the BTAA Geoportal benefits students,
researchers, and faculty.

Interface Committee is exploring what the clearest terms should be for
describing resource types and subtypes in order to make the Data Type
facet more useful to users.

ArcGIS Working Group is developing a Best Practices for Open Data
Portals guide (for data providers) with a focus on publishing services
and metadata creation in ArcGIS Online.

Analytics Working Group has been formed in order to determine what
questions we want to answer (based on goals / strategic plans) using
analytics data, how we can collect/package that data, and how we might
go about promoting the use of the Geoportal based on that data.

## Next Steps

### Steering Committee
