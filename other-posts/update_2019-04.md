# Project Update: April 2019

<!-- more -->

## Highlights

The committees made strides in their efforts to develop educational and
promotional content for the geoportal. A series of videos were created,
several blog posts were published to a new platform, the project's
[Google Site](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/btaa-gdp/news),
and Task Force members from Purdue University presented about the
geoportal at the Annual Association of Geographers (AAG) conference.

The upgrade to GeoBlacklight 2.0 continued to require attention, as it
resulted in both new features and underlying bugs. The new field
allowing "suppressed" records meant that hundreds of page-level records
for atlases and sheet maps could be added to the geoportal without
cluttering search results. Additionally, retired records could be
suppressed rather than removed, which will improve collection analytics
in the future. For troubleshooting bugs, the Product Owner worked with
Web Development to identify several issues, including a problem with the
Google Analytics configuration. Although the connection was repaired,
there are no analytics for the month of April.

Project sponsors, on behalf of the Strategic Leadership Group, began
conducting exploratory interviews with decision makers at BTAA libraries
to gauge interest in a scope expansion to the project that would include
collective archiving and web service strategies.
